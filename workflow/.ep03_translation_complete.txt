CONTENT SUMMARY:
Topic: Support & Resistance - Part 2 of Price Action Teaching Series
Teaching style: Casual, conversational, interactive with military metaphors
Key concepts taught:
1. Horizontal Support/Resistance (Type 1)
2. Price zones vs single price lines (emphasized 15+ times)
3. Role reversal: Support ↔ Resistance when broken
4. Swing points identification (Swing High/Low)
5. Strength of levels (tested multiple times = stronger)
6. Multi-timeframe analysis (Weekly → 4H → 1H)
7. Dynamic S/R: Trendlines and Channels
8. Fibonacci retracement (23.6%, 38.2%, 50%, 61.8%, 78.6%)
9. Golden Ratio (61.8%) emphasis
10. Combining S/R with candlestick patterns (Pinbar at S/R = high probability)
11. Military metaphors: Market = Battlefield, S/R = City walls, Price = Army

TRANSCRIPTION ERRORS FIXED:
✓ "แนวลับ" → Support (transcribed wrong ~60 times, should be แนวรับ)
✓ "Player Action"/"Pry Action"/"ไพรแอคชั่น" → Price Action (3 instances)
✓ "สนามลบ" → battlefield (should be สนามรบ, 1 instance)

MILITARY METAPHORS PRESERVED:
- กำแพง → wall/barrier (15x)
- ทัพ → army/forces (8x)
- บุก → attack/push (6x)
- ตั้งรับ → defend/hold (4x)
- สนามรบ → battlefield (market as war zone)
- กระทิงชนหมี → bulls vs bears battle
