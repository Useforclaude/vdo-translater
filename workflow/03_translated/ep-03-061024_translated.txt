[1] 1.04s - 1.58s
Hello everyone.

[2] 2.56s - 4.80s
In this Part, we'll continue with

[3] 5.26s - 7.96s
Price Action, focusing on Support and Resistance.

[4] 9.16s - 13.16s
After we've learned and understood about candlesticks

[5] 13.50s - 14.10s
from

[6] 15.00s - 15.90s
the previous Parts

[7] 16.64s - 20.30s
whether it's reading Momentum, reading candlesticks like we're telling a story

[8] 20.80s - 23.50s
like scenes in a movie

[9] 24.40s - 27.42s
battlefield, or whatever comparison you want to make.

[10] 27.62s - 29.52s
Now let's continue with Support and Resistance.

[11] 29.52s - 32.44s
This will make reading our charts

[12] 32.44s - 34.32s
or Price Action, which is

[13] 34.62s - 37.34s
the action of price, the movement of price

[14] 37.80s - 39.52s
much clearer than reading

[15] 40.52s - 43.10s
candlesticks alone.

[16] 44.46s - 45.98s
Let's get started.

[17] 47.74s - 50.70s
Price Action isn't just about Support and Resistance.

[18] 50.70s - 54.30s
There are about 3-5 patterns.

[19] 54.30s - 58.82s
I'll show you the really interesting ones.

[20] 61.66s - 63.42s
First of all, Support and Resistance

[21] 63.42s - 68.58s
Type 1: Horizontal.

[22] 68.58s - 71.06s
The word horizontal, a horizontal level like this.

[23] 74.08s - 81.72s
First, view it as a price zone. The concept is to see it as a price zone, not as a single line or single price.

[24] 81.72s - 84.60s
View it as a price range, as a zone, covering an area.

[25] 85.54s - 91.58s
If it's above, we call it Resistance. If it's below the price, we call it Support.

[26] 91.58s - 96.74s
The meaning, if we go by pure theory, it would be too much. Let's keep it short.

[27] 97.46s - 103.88s
Resistance, to translate it simply in Price Action or price terms, it resists

[28] 103.88s - 107.20s
and prevents it from going up. Simple. It's like a wall.

[29] 108.10s - 125.26s
It's like a barrier. When price comes up and hits it, there's resistance.

[30] 125.26s - 129.48s
Or a price wall. As for Support, the meaning is literal.

[31] 129.64s - 135.16s
It supports and prevents it from going down. That's the concept. Resistance prevents upward movement.

[32] 136.00s - 142.14s
If Support means it supports and prevents downward movement. Now, how do we create Support

[33] 142.14s - 146.46s
and Resistance levels? Look at Swing Points.

[34] 146.68s - 150.68s
The term Swing Point means it goes up then goes down.

[35] 151.16s - 154.28s
If it's in the middle of price movement like this, we won't use it.

[36] 155.52s - 156.84s
Use where it reverses.

[37] 156.84s - 160.12s
Because it means it must have hit something, couldn't continue

[38] 160.12s - 162.44s
and had to go in the other direction. Right?

[39] 163.20s - 166.28s
Like these, it hits then continues on.

[40] 166.28s - 172.30s
We won't use these as Support or Resistance. When it can't continue and bounces back

[41] 172.30s - 179.48s
hits and bounces back, we'll use these. Like this, can't continue, reverses down. Comes down, can't

[42] 179.48s - 184.70s
continue, reverses up. Every Swing Point like this, we'll use as Support or Resistance.

[43] 185.52s - 189.00s
If it's above, it definitely resists upward movement. Above must be Resistance.

[44] 189.22s - 191.66s
Below, it supports and prevents downward movement, so it must be Support.

[45] 193.58s - 200.00s
And as I said from the start, count it as a zone, not drawing a single line as a price.

[46] 203.08s - 208.56s
Support and Resistance, according to their meaning, is resisting and preventing downward movement.

[47] 208.56s - 213.36s
This means Resistance often has price reversals

[48] 213.36s - 215.80s
when it's been rising, rising, rising

[49] 215.80s - 217.88s
and when it hits, it reverses down.

[50] 218.72s - 220.18s
Support is the same.

[51] 221.10s - 223.32s
It keeps dropping, dropping, dropping down.

[52] 223.32s - 225.70s
When it hits Support, it supports and prevents downward movement.

[53] 225.70s - 227.34s
According to the concept's name.

[54] 227.34s - 230.46s
Support, it means there's a chance

[55] 230.46s - 233.12s
let's use the word "chance." There's a chance it will reverse upward.

[56] 233.44s - 236.54s
Away from the original direction that was coming down to hit Support.

[57] 236.96s - 239.68s
As for Resistance, away from the original direction that was coming up to hit Resistance

[58] 239.68s - 241.80s
which is the opposite direction, which is down.

[59] 242.88s - 245.14s
There's usually a price reversal by

[60] 245.70s - 247.48s
reading it together with candlesticks.

[61] 248.62s - 249.50s
See? Pinbar.

[62] 250.32s - 252.40s
Pinbar going down, right? Down.

[63] 253.54s - 256.86s
This one's a group, but if you combine them, it becomes a Pinbar too.

[64] 257.36s - 261.64s
In the principle of combining candlesticks that we learned in the earlier Parts.

[65] 262.12s - 268.20s
Therefore, Support and Resistance, we'll use them together with candlesticks that show buying or selling pressure.

[66] 269.38s - 274.20s
If the candlesticks we know, that we learned in the candlestick Part

[67] 274.20s - 284.38s
if we encounter them in the middle of the chart, they won't really produce results according to their names, like reversal candlesticks and such.

[68] 284.38s - 296.24s
Candlesticks will have clear effects only when they're found in areas that are Support or Resistance zones. Only then will they clearly produce those expected results.

[69] 299.18s - 308.04s
Which case? Like coming down and encountering a candle like this. This isn't a Pinbar. Where is it?

[70] 311.48s - 315.66s
And if it's not in a Support or Resistance zone, like this

[71] 315.66s - 322.48s
Pinbar shows buying pressure returning. Dropping, dropping, dropping, but why doesn't it reverse back up like this?

[72] 323.00s - 326.54s
Because it's in the middle of a trend. It's not in a Support or Resistance area.

[73] 326.54s - 330.10s
Like this, see? When it's here, it goes up.

[74] 330.82s - 335.32s
See? It produces clearer effects. Simply put.

[75] 339.00s - 342.48s
Another concept of Support and Resistance you need to know is

[76] 343.12s - 346.92s
originally, if it's above like this, price moves up and hits it.

[77] 348.04s - 352.86s
Coming from below up to hit above, that's called Resistance. Right?

[78] 353.48s - 360.10s
But whenever Resistance is broken through upward, when price breaks through upward

[79] 360.84s - 365.78s
it immediately switches from Resistance, its role changes, to become Support.

[80] 365.78s - 372.08s
From originally resisting upward movement, preventing upward movement

[81] 372.08s - 376.30s
when it breaks through, simply put, the resistance couldn't hold, it broke.

[82] 376.82s - 379.98s
Breaks up. When it reverses back down

[83] 380.52s - 383.86s
what used to be Resistance will change to become Support, supporting and preventing downward movement.

[84] 383.86s - 386.56s
In the same level, same zone.

[85] 386.94s - 389.82s
Comes down. Retest, simply put, comes down to test.

[86] 391.94s - 394.58s
Resisted upward movement, got broken through, damaged.

[87] 394.96s - 398.26s
Therefore, it's no longer Resistance because it's below the price.

[88] 398.26s - 401.48s
It becomes Support, according to its name. Supports and prevents downward movement.

[89] 401.48s - 405.00s
So it becomes a reversal point to continue.

[90] 405.24s - 407.58s
It will change its role. Like this one is Support.

[91] 408.08s - 412.02s
Supports preventing downward movement, bounces up. Supports preventing downward movement, bounces up.

[92] 412.72s - 415.58s
Finally, it gets destroyed. From Support it becomes Resistance.

[93] 415.96s - 419.28s
Price comes back up to retest, comes up to hit again.

[94] 419.74s - 423.52s
So originally it supported preventing downward movement.

[95] 423.52s - 427.20s
When it's damaged and broken, it means it got broken through downward.

[96] 427.20s - 430.12s
It will change its role to become Resistance preventing upward movement.

[97] 430.48s - 434.10s
Come here. Understand the concept and remember it.

[98] 434.64s - 435.56s
Then it drops.

[99] 437.36s - 438.60s
Here, this is Support.

[100] 439.20s - 442.84s
This breaks down. Support changes to Resistance.

[101] 443.76s - 446.36s
Comes up to hit, and the same point that used to be Support before

[102] 446.36s - 449.32s
now resists preventing upward movement, then drops.

[103] 449.32s - 454.58s
Down. This is the role of Support and Resistance.

[104] 455.48s - 457.88s
Like in this picture, it's also Support and Resistance.

[105] 458.30s - 460.78s
But it's like the trend we've been seeing.

[106] 460.78s - 464.10s
It's a trend.

[107] 464.10s - 466.00s
This might be a clearer trend.

[108] 466.00s - 467.42s
Going up step by step like stairs.

[109] 468.54s - 470.44s
Hits, then hits and drops.

[110] 470.64s - 472.46s
This is Support, bounces up.

[111] 472.46s - 479.76s
Goes and breaks through, right? Breaks through, then hits a new barrier, which might have existed before.

[112] 479.76s - 487.84s
It drops. When it comes down here, what was this? It was Resistance, got broken through, switches its role to become Support, supports preventing downward movement.

[113] 488.16s - 494.30s
It continues up. This one used to resist, couldn't hold, got broken through. Reverses down, it supports preventing downward movement.

[114] 494.30s - 502.62s
Changes role. Breaks through again, goes up to hit Resistance, comes down to hit Support, that's how its steps continue like this.

[115] 505.28s - 512.50s
And the principle for drawing good Support and Resistance is to start from the larger timeframe down.

[116] 512.94s - 518.22s
Like this will be a weekly timeframe, a weekly chart, weekly graph, this is Resistance.

[117] 518.22s - 522.38s
See? It's a major level. Go ahead and draw it. It's a zone, a Support zone.

[118] 522.38s - 528.38s
When it zooms down to daily, if it moves up and hits here, and forms a reversal candlestick pattern

[119] 528.38s - 533.46s
like this, it's around this area that belongs to

[120] 533.46s - 536.74s
a larger timeframe. Therefore, it will be thick, solid, as a

[121] 536.74s - 539.40s
strong Resistance. Using the word "strong," how many points?

[122] 539.40s - 544.04s
Count them. One, two, three, four, five. The word "strong" means there's

[123] 544.04s - 546.44s
it's been hit multiple times already, whether Support or Resistance.

[124] 546.44s - 549.14s
Using the term hit multiple times, price has hit and crashed into it.

[125] 549.42s - 552.62s
But couldn't break through. If it's Resistance, couldn't break up.

[126] 552.62s - 554.18s
If it's Support, couldn't break down.

[127] 554.18s - 557.22s
That shows the level is even stronger.

[128] 557.24s - 562.32s
This is why it drops so much, so far, after hitting Resistance.

[129] 563.38s - 570.62s
Let's look at a real chart for a bit. A real chart. Look at the points.

[130] 571.44s - 575.50s
This head, draw it like this. This is horizontal.

[131] 575.50s - 579.24s
Our horizontal lines, we're talking about horizontal, so draw them.

[132] 581.06s - 589.06s
This is drawing from what we see. But if we do it properly, know the history first.

[133] 590.38s - 594.26s
Suppose I'm comfortable trading the 1-hour timeframe.

[134] 595.06s - 599.14s
I'll take the larger one to control first, which is 4-hour.

[135] 601.76s - 607.24s
This is the point where it swung, came down then reversed up forming a tail showing returning strength.

[136] 607.70s - 613.06s
Then go back to the past. See? There's this point where it came down and went up.

[137] 614.22s - 620.26s
Here it hit and went up. This shows this level works. So we draw it for the 4-hour.

[138] 622.28s - 627.14s
Where else? Like here it has bounces. This is interesting. See?

[139] 627.72s - 632.68s
Comes up, hits and drops. What role did it play, remember?

[140] 632.68s - 636.68s
It was Resistance, resisted upward movement. Finally the Resistance broke, broke through.

[141] 636.88s - 640.66s
Reverses back. What is it now? From Resistance it changed to Support.

[142] 640.66s - 646.00s
Supports preventing downward movement. Can't go down, so it goes up. See?

[143] 646.70s - 650.12s
But there's another thing I mentioned, don't forget.

[144] 650.12s - 652.42s
We don't look at it as a single line.

[145] 652.42s - 656.20s
Not taking this price, a single price. It's not this price that is Support or Resistance.

[146] 657.02s - 660.34s
We take it as a zone. Like this, if you draw it as a zone

[147] 661.58s - 663.76s
it becomes clearer like this. See?

[148] 664.70s - 667.88s
This, it touches the zone, touches the zone, touches the zone a bit.

[149] 667.88s - 682.40s
And finally it stays. And comes down touching the zone.

[150] 682.40s - 688.82s
Resistance is here, this zone. You can combine them all this way, combine them all.

[151] 689.38s - 693.66s
Like this. It hits and drops, hits and drops, hits and drops. See?

[152] 694.74s - 699.36s
So we mark it like this. After marking on the larger timeframe

[153] 700.10s - 704.94s
we'll break it down to smaller timeframes, well, smaller ones

[154] 705.00s - 707.70s
and mark what we just saw. Look at the left side.

[155] 707.70s - 710.36s
This is our left side. Here's where the current price is running on the chart.

[156] 710.66s - 712.70s
So we look back at the past.

[157] 712.70s - 715.92s
The points where it clearly bounced up. Here.

[158] 715.92s - 734.98s
We mark and set them up.

[159] 734.98s - 738.72s
If the line is above the price, that means it's Resistance.

[160] 739.06s - 748.48s
Therefore, if price breaks through this Resistance upward

[161] 750.74s - 754.28s
Breaks through. Price runs, boom, breaks up.

[162] 755.10s - 760.20s
Where will it go next? It'll be clear, right? There's nothing blocking it anymore.

[163] 760.48s - 764.30s
Price will keep running until it hits the next Resistance.

[164] 766.32s - 768.34s
The next level.

[165] 769.74s - 773.14s
When price goes up and hits it, we need to watch at that moment to see if price

[166] 773.74s - 776.56s
will hit and pass through, or if it doesn't pass then

[167] 778.18s - 780.92s
it'll reverse down. Look at the candlesticks.

[168] 781.42s - 783.88s
Reverses back down. Look, this is the old Resistance.

[169] 784.26s - 787.42s
Already broken through. It becomes Support. Comes down to test Support.

[170] 788.70s - 790.42s
Right here. Boom.

[171] 793.38s - 796.66s
Comes to test if it holds.

[172] 797.38s - 800.40s
Right. It holds.

[173] 800.62s - 804.22s
It holds. If it holds, price returns.

[174] 805.60s - 806.46s
Goes back up.

[175] 809.12s - 812.86s
If there's a lot of buying pressure, it might break through this Resistance.

[176] 812.86s - 816.24s
Could break out. Break out like this, could go far.

[177] 816.84s - 822.32s
If it breaks, where will it go? To the next Resistance. Right here.

[178] 825.50s - 830.22s
Goes and hits it. Resistance does its job resisting upward movement. Then it'll curve down again.

[179] 830.22s - 833.80s
It'll reverse downward again. It'll keep going like this.

[180] 835.20s - 839.84s
Understand now? Support and Resistance in horizontal form.

[181] 839.84s - 843.58s
You mark where you see repeated points.

[182] 843.58s - 847.10s
Like three or so. For example, when I mark here, did I mark this correctly?

[183] 847.10s - 851.58s
We haven't seen what's behind yet. Based on what we see now, it should hit this line.

[184] 852.30s - 858.92s
This is Support, comes down and bounces, comes down and bounces up, breaks through, breaks through, comes back. This level must become Resistance, right?

[185] 858.92s - 864.14s
And it comes up here. It resists down, resists down, resists down. Finally

[186] 864.14s - 869.72s
it breaks down. All the way here. Reached this major Support zone.

[187] 870.14s - 874.64s
Very clear Support. When it hits, see? It holds and prevents it from dropping.

[188] 874.64s - 879.14s
It holds and bounces up like this. See? Now if it can break through

[189] 879.14s - 883.46s
Boom, breaks down. Down. It reverses back up and hits this zone.

[190] 883.46s - 886.66s
This Resistance zone. Originally it was Support. Already broken.

[191] 886.66s - 892.02s
Change its name. It becomes Resistance. It resists, prevents upward movement. So it drops.

[192] 892.02s - 899.04s
Price drops. Hits there and drops out. Here. Now if we try to look back

[193] 899.04s - 907.08s
Let me look back. Here, here, here, here, here. See? Hit here again. This zone again.

[194] 907.08s - 911.46s
This zone again. See? Hits and drops. Comes down and hits. Here and goes up. Bounces, bounces, bounces.

[195] 911.46s - 917.00s
Until it's able to break through. Here it reverses up to hit again. Here. See? Here.

[196] 917.00s - 921.82s
About this much is good enough. Looks like it broke through a bit, but couldn't continue.

[197] 921.82s - 926.92s
So it drops like this. Still counts because like I said, Support and Resistance aren't viewed as a single price line.

[198] 926.92s - 930.94s
It's a Price Zone. Like this. Like this. See?

[199] 932.00s - 936.70s
Here. Here. We didn't know before. We don't know what's behind. We mark what we see now.

[200] 936.70s - 940.02s
Based on current data, these 3 points didn't break. Mark here first.

[201] 941.40s - 946.52s
Here too. Right. Once we mark it, it misses. After it misses, we look back to see if this level is really strong.

[202] 947.50s - 952.82s
It all checks out. This is a zone, see? It doesn't reach exactly, but remember it's a zone.

[203] 952.82s - 956.08s
It's a Price Zone. So it drops like this.

[204] 956.58s - 960.24s
Therefore, this line should be fairly strong.

[205] 960.54s - 962.96s
Therefore, if price, or here, comes up to hit here

[206] 963.90s - 969.32s
we analyze or consider the trend

[207] 969.32s - 972.08s
that there's a chance it won't break on the first try.

[208] 972.42s - 974.32s
Might reverse back first.

[209] 975.48s - 977.14s
Come to form new patterns, then go up.

[210] 977.56s - 981.00s
This is the point where we'll consider buying or selling pressure

[211] 981.00s - 985.24s
to see who wins, who dominates more, from what we learned about

[212] 985.72s - 989.56s
about reading candlesticks. We look at it together with

[213] 989.56s - 991.84s
this right here. We'll see a clearer picture than when we first

[214] 991.84s - 1010.98s
learned about candlesticks. We read them candle by candle.

[215] 1011.80s - 1018.64s
Like before, we read by going up, until we reach here. Reading here, it's strong. Selling pressure is strong. Probably won't hold.

[216] 1018.64s - 1025.14s
Reading down, up, up, down, and so on. Reading continuously, there was no, basically no focal point.

[217] 1025.74s - 1029.20s
There might be a percentage that makes our reading and analysis of candlesticks

[218] 1029.20s - 1032.48s
or buying/selling pressure or Momentum

[219] 1033.28s - 1035.84s
less accurate. But if combined with Support and Resistance

[220] 1035.84s - 1038.82s
it's a level we already know that it must play an important role where

[221] 1039.04s - 1041.04s
price must do something in these zones.

[222] 1041.92s - 1042.82s
If we compare it to

[223] 1042.82s - 1048.14s
like comparing to the candlestick lessons we learned, Momentum as a battlefield

[224] 1048.14s - 1051.90s
there are 2 cities fighting each other, to seize territory

[225] 1051.90s - 1053.84s
who can enter whose territory more

[226] 1054.24s - 1059.04s
Support and Resistance are like city walls or checkpoint walls.

[227] 1059.56s - 1062.88s
So when it's a checkpoint wall, that means the wall must have who?

[228] 1063.54s - 1066.88s
Must have soldiers guarding, obstacles blocking, right?

[229] 1066.88s - 1070.88s
So we need to look at the forces battling there to see if they can destroy the wall.

[230] 1070.88s - 1075.00s
This side, the city on this side, if it's an uptrend going up to hit Resistance, we need to see if

[231] 1075.58s - 1079.54s
the army attacking, coming to assault, does it have strong or weak forces?

[232] 1079.54s - 1085.30s
Is it at full strength or is it weakening? Against the army waiting to defend on the wall

[233] 1085.30s - 1089.94s
at this level that already exists. Will this side be able to resist?

[234] 1090.48s - 1095.82s
Can they push the enemy back? We'll know step by step.

[235] 1096.08s - 1099.70s
Instead of reading candlesticks continuously from what we learned about Momentum

[236] 1099.70s - 1101.92s
which already gives us information as a story

[237] 1101.92s - 1105.54s
if we understand from the previous lessons, from previous parts

[238] 1105.54s - 1108.98s
we can already read Momentum and candlesticks as a continuous story.

[239] 1108.98s - 1112.16s
When we combine it with Support and Resistance as zones

[240] 1113.36s - 1118.80s
it tells us exactly which points we should focus our reading on more.

[241] 1119.14s - 1123.28s
Instead of reading through dozens of candles, which might be confusing

[242] 1123.46s - 1127.32s
information might be wrong or inaccurate. But if we already know the positions we need to focus on

[243] 1127.32s - 1130.98s
we just read buying or selling pressure at the moments when there are Support and Resistance

[244] 1131.36s - 1135.20s
positions like these instead. It'll save us more time.

[245] 1135.58s - 1139.90s
But if you want the overall picture or want to analyze more deeply

[246] 1141.22s - 1143.90s
we read like we read before

[247] 1143.90s - 1146.88s
from previous lessons, read through the entire set, read continuously

[248] 1147.24s - 1152.04s
but at points where you encounter Support and Resistance, analyze more specifically

[249] 1153.94s - 1155.22s
whether it will go or not go.

[250] 1155.86s - 1161.08s
Because if it goes, it must go to the next level. Each level basically tells us, besides preventing upward movement


[251] 1167.20s - 1172.26s
like I said before, this is the city wall. If the forces attack and break through

[252] 1172.90s - 1178.62s
the next wall is here. Now you ask, what happens in this zone?

[253] 1178.62s - 1180.96s
It doesn't do much. The troops just keep advancing

[254] 1180.96s - 1185.78s
to attack the next wall or next city. That's it, to seize the new city and keep attacking forward.

[255] 1186.98s - 1190.28s
If we compare it to warfare, it's exactly like this. It's normal.

[256] 1190.28s - 1193.54s
In the function of Support like this, it holds price from dropping

[257] 1193.54s - 1199.10s
so if it drops through, it broke this wall already, so it must go attack the next city wall which is the next zone.

[258] 1199.92s - 1202.78s
Send the soldiers. When soldiers reach the next wall zone

[259] 1202.78s - 1220.26s
the troops from this side send forces to fight, to fight and reclaim the territory back.

[260] 1220.26s - 1222.54s
That's why they defend to prevent us from entering their territory too.

[261] 1223.26s - 1225.36s
Hit, hit, hit, down, down

[262] 1226.10s - 1227.14s
So we analyze like this.

[263] 1227.74s - 1228.66s
If it drops, where does it go?

[264] 1228.66s - 1233.12s
If the forces from below try to push up and lose

[265] 1234.60s - 1236.78s
they'll retreat as normal. If we go fight

[266] 1237.92s - 1240.06s
and we lose, or we can't fight anymore, we're exhausted

[267] 1240.94s - 1241.82s
where do we have to go?

[268] 1242.76s - 1244.98s
We have to return to our base, return to our army camp.

[269] 1245.46s - 1249.08s
The question is, if we fight here and can't hold, we must return to Support level where it was before

[270] 1249.08s - 1253.20s
like we go back, go rest first. It already won here before, we're defending here

[271] 1253.20s - 1274.96s
right? This is considered their city wall. But fighting here doesn't work anymore.

[272] 1274.96s - 1281.16s
When the army advances this big, like a wall appears, it protects the zone.

[273] 1281.16s - 1285.46s
Taking that zone becomes the zone they're holding, according to the size of their candle.

[274] 1285.86s - 1291.54s
When price hits and can't break through, encountered this level before, they retreat back.

[275] 1293.52s - 1296.98s
See this huge candle? Remember?

[276] 1298.32s - 1303.72s
If suddenly there are small candles and then a big candle appears from the start

[277] 1303.72s - 1310.74s
that's it, the trend will go in the big candle's direction for a while. So see? When it comes, it goes this way again.

[278] 1310.74s - 1318.64s
It sends forces this way again. Like it can't fight back, right? So it keeps sending the same army here.

[279] 1318.64s - 1333.70s
They move the army, move the army here, attack, attack inward, attack until the defending forces can't hold anymore.

[280] 1333.70s - 1353.24s
Keep going continuously.

[281] 1353.66s - 1357.92s
See? It's like in this area, after breaking through for a while

[282] 1357.92s - 1361.08s
in this area they have new forces forming a wall right here.

[283] 1361.08s - 1364.48s
How did this happen? If you look back at this line, this line

[284] 1366.38s - 1368.10s
See here? It bounces back.

[285] 1370.36s - 1374.64s
This is this zone. Hit then drop, struggling here, hit

[286] 1376.54s - 1377.48s
This one

[287] 1377.48s - 1384.50s
This shows they still have military forces waiting

[288] 1386.56s - 1393.10s
waiting to fight. That's why it must bounce. The army is coming. Simply put, they might be tired from traveling.

[289] 1393.62s - 1396.98s
Momentum starts decreasing, the big candles start getting smaller and smaller and smaller.

[290] 1398.18s - 1402.94s
Trying their best to push but in the end might start weakening.

[291] 1402.94s - 1409.92s
Then small green candles gradually creep up, and finally defeat this army.

[292] 1410.36s - 1415.54s
See? Price manages to close above this one. So keep fighting. Fight to where?

[293] 1416.08s - 1419.22s
Fight back to where they just crossed over the city wall here.

[294] 1419.22s - 1432.92s
This first checkpoint wall. Come here, then go back up to reclaim it.

[295] 1432.92s - 1436.46s
Make it ours again, so the enemy doesn't reclaim it.

[296] 1436.46s - 1440.66s
Hit then drop, hit then drop, hit then drop, trying to reclaim it.

[297] 1440.66s - 1445.98s
Still can't reclaim it yet of course, because here it's still considered in the period of

[298] 1447.02s - 1452.02s
sideways. Still fighting each other on this level. Here might be winning a bit

[299] 1452.24s - 1456.08s
then shifts to the next Resistance level, which is here. Still fighting.

[300] 1456.08s - 1461.36s
It's just the strength of Momentum, candlesticks, like we've read before

[301] 1462.70s - 1470.34s
it'll make analysis easier, clearer, increase your trading percentage even more.

[302] 1470.34s - 1472.20s
Let's continue watching.

[303] 1475.58s - 1478.92s
Next up is Dynamic Support and Resistance, or the sloped type.

[304] 1478.92s - 1490.68s
Earlier, Support and Resistance were horizontal, right? Now the sloped type, how is it? It's trendlines basically.

[305] 1491.46s - 1498.08s
Let me open a new one, let's say this one works.

[306] 1506.86s - 1507.28s
Let's continue.

[307] 1507.28s - 1508.26s
This one I like Fuji.

[308] 1509.38s - 1516.54s
We can look at this one.

[309] 1517.56s - 1520.00s
At first, this one already went like this.

[310] 1520.20s - 1521.32s
See, it's a zone?

[311] 1522.34s - 1523.30s
The horizontal one.

[312] 1523.30s - 1527.70s
Bouncing for a long period because if you know

[313] 1527.92s - 1530.40s
it switches roles, from Support to Resistance.

[314] 1531.70s - 1534.30s
Goes up, hits, drops. See?

[315] 1535.20s - 1537.96s
Now we move to the horizontal type, we already know that.

[316] 1538.86s - 1544.10s
Let's do the sloped type, the one with slope like this.

[317] 1545.36s - 1545.96s
Draw like this.

[318] 1550.26s - 1554.56s
If it's a downtrend, we'll draw from the peak downward like this.

[319] 1556.08s - 1559.68s
Then create a channel to make it parallel, let it run like this.

[320] 1561.28s - 1567.40s
You'll see it becomes Support and Resistance in diagonal form like this.

[321] 1570.96s - 1575.82s
It's on top, it's a downtrend. So along this line

[322] 1576.80s - 1580.38s
it must be Resistance.

[323] 1580.66s - 1583.88s
Below, when it's below it becomes Support.

[324] 1586.82s - 1589.82s
When price comes to hit the lower line it becomes Support.

[325] 1592.82s - 1594.54s
This one first, Support like this.

[326] 1610.38s - 1612.22s
Here, right here

[327] 1615.30s - 1624.62s
Around here, see?

[328] 1625.66s - 1629.38s
When we draw trendlines, we'll draw two clear points first.

[329] 1629.38s - 1630.50s
Use this as point one.

[330] 1631.52s - 1634.02s
Point two, take a nearby point, nearby peak.

[331] 1634.50s - 1636.50s
This one might be a bit off, skip it.

[332] 1647.04s - 1651.86s
We take this point and this point, these two points, then let the rest run.

[333] 1655.70s - 1660.54s
For this we create a parallel channel at points it passed through before.

[334] 1662.56s - 1667.72s
The top will be Resistance. Price runs down, reverses back up.

[335] 1668.48s - 1673.56s
Sometimes price reverses back and forth, we might not see on the horizontal axis

[336] 1673.56s - 1678.04s
why it bounces. Like here it might be struggling, not clear.

[337] 1678.28s - 1684.94s
Why does it drop? But actually here there's a little bit.

[338] 1688.04s - 1697.20s
Around here. They're fighting. Try looking back, is there anything? It's still not clear.

[339] 1698.80s - 1704.12s
Actually we can kind of see it in another technique which we'll cover later, which is Fibo.

[340] 1704.76s - 1711.28s
It happens to drop and retrace to around 55%, then it drops. But today we'll talk about it later.

[341] 1712.38s - 1715.78s
But since it already happened, we take the point where it occurred, this swing

[342] 1716.48s - 1720.82s
and this swing, connect them together and extend it out.

[343] 1721.46s - 1725.52s
It becomes a channel. Make the bottom parallel to be Support.

[344] 1725.52s - 1726.98s
We have Resistance already, now we'll have Support.

[345] 1727.22s - 1733.02s
That's why when price runs to hit Support or the diagonal line, it goes up.

[346] 1734.86s - 1740.44s
Hits, goes up, hits, hits. Goes down, down, down, down, down, down, hits again, then goes up. See?

[347] 1740.44s - 1744.96s
Because if we want to know, wait, what's on the horizontal level that makes it go up?

[348] 1744.96s - 1750.80s
It has to go up here. We can try observing this line.

[349] 1759.30s - 1765.84s
This line, this line, horizontal. Oh okay, because when it reverses back below, there's still a point where it must bounce.

[350] 1770.74s - 1776.70s
And it also has this line, so we can consider this one quite strong because there are 2 overlapping lines.

[351] 1777.84s - 1784.48s
Two stories, two types of Support and Resistance switching roles.

[352] 1784.48s - 1789.64s
Switching roles. In an uptrend, is there an uptrend? Yeah, uptrend first.

[353] 1789.64s - 1793.08s
This one here, then we take this point, this Low.

[354] 1796.50s - 1797.66s
The clear one would be like this one.

[355] 1800.74s - 1802.04s
Let's zoom in a bit more.

[356] 1803.82s - 1804.78s
Want to make it clearer.

[357] 1809.88s - 1810.96s
Draw a channel there.

[358] 1812.88s - 1817.94s
The bottom will become Support.

[359] 1821.26s - 1822.74s
At this point we'll take it as point 2.

[360] 1822.74s - 1825.20s
So we don't know if it's Support yet.

[361] 1825.40s - 1829.30s
We have to wait for this formation to happen first, then we can draw it like this.

[362] 1829.50s - 1831.68s
Once we draw it like this, it means we've got the top.

[363] 1832.10s - 1834.24s
So the top has to become Resistance, right?

[364] 1835.66s - 1838.46s
So when price runs from this point up,

[365] 1839.08s - 1842.16s
pretty strong momentum too, runs up strongly, and this green candle,

[366] 1842.16s - 1845.98s
this long and big, boom! Hits Resistance.

[367] 1847.30s - 1850.64s
Still can't break through. That's why it curves down.

[368] 1851.32s - 1854.14s
Ah! Tests again, still can't break through.

[369] 1854.14s - 1856.88s
This one's like the final strike, boom!

[370] 1857.62s - 1858.80s
But you see,

[371] 1858.80s - 1860.18s
if we read by Momentum and candlesticks,

[372] 1861.22s - 1864.20s
it shows there's selling pressure, an Engulfing back.

[373] 1864.20s - 1866.72s
The other side won't let it go through, simply put.

[374] 1867.18s - 1869.68s
So it reverses back because it's a Resistance zone.

[375] 1870.68s - 1874.20s
Same thing, even though it's diagonal, we can still count it as a zone.

[376] 1876.52s - 1878.74s
Take the closing prices and the shadows, we can draw it.

[377] 1880.74s - 1882.90s
So it reverses back into the Channel.

[378] 1883.76s - 1884.28s
Like this.

[379] 1886.42s - 1888.70s
Then it comes down here, tests.

[380] 1888.70s - 1891.44s
Tests Support, bounces up.

[381] 1891.44s - 1893.26s
Goes up, comes back down to test again.

[382] 1894.12s - 1903.52s
Down here, tests, bounces, tests.

[383] 1904.08s - 1913.44s
See? It keeps testing Support.

[384] 1914.44s - 1918.10s
This shows the diagonal line we drew

[385] 1918.10s - 1923.50s
is acting as Support.

[386] 1923.50s - 1927.50s
When price hits it, it bounces.

[387] 1927.50s - 1932.60s
But look at this area,

[388] 1932.60s - 1938.30s
when it breaks below Support,

[389] 1938.86s - 1939.80s
this Support line

[390] 1941.96s - 1946.66s
will switch to become Resistance.

[391] 1946.66s - 1950.76s
See? Once it breaks below,

[392] 1951.68s - 1954.90s
it tests from below, can't break through.

[393] 1954.90s - 1958.44s
Tests again, can't break through.

[394] 1961.50s - 1965.90s
This means the diagonal line switched roles

[395] 1967.00s - 1972.02s
from Support to Resistance.

[396] 1972.96s - 1976.74s
Same concept as horizontal Support/Resistance,

[397] 1978.84s - 1982.62s
just on a diagonal.

[398] 1982.96s - 1988.54s
So whether it's horizontal or diagonal,

[399] 1989.38s - 1994.34s
Support and Resistance can switch roles.

[400] 1996.16s - 2004.20s
This is what we call dynamic Support and Resistance.

[401] 2005.48s - 2012.18s
Because it has a slope, it's not flat.

[402] 2013.94s - 2017.56s
It moves with the trend.

[403] 2018.40s - 2020.30s
That's why we call it dynamic.

[404] 2023.08s - 2024.40s
Alright, so this is trendlines and channels.

[405] 2026.20s - 2029.80s
Very useful for drawing Support and Resistance

[406] 2029.80s - 2036.42s
that moves with price.

[407] 2037.74s - 2042.92s
Now let's look at

[408] 2043.72s - 2048.94s
another tool, which is

[409] 2050.18s - 2056.66s
Fibonacci.

[410] 2058.00s - 2061.60s
Fibonacci, or Fibo for short,

[411] 2061.60s - 2068.66s
is a tool we use to find

[412] 2068.66s - 2072.44s
Support and Resistance zones too.

[413] 2073.04s - 2086.64s
But it's based on percentages

[414] 2086.64s - 2088.78s
of the price movement.

[415] 2089.30s - 2092.20s
The key levels are

[416] 2093.84s - 2095.02s
23.6%, 38.2%, 50%,

[417] 2096.86s - 2099.26s
61.8%, and 78.6%.

[418] 2099.26s - 2101.70s
The most important is 61.8%,

[419] 2101.96s - 2102.64s
also called the Golden Ratio.

[420] 2104.38s - 2106.04s
We use Fibo to measure

[421] 2107.00s - 2108.34s
where price might pull back to.

[422] 2109.34s - 2112.18s
Let me show you how.

[423] 2117.90s - 2121.00s
In an uptrend,

[424] 2130.04s - 2134.06s
we draw from Low to High.

[425] 2134.82s - 2139.60s
Like this swing here,

[426] 2139.60s - 2146.80s
from this Low

[427] 2146.80s - 2148.42s
to this High.

[428] 2152.44s - 2158.80s
Then when price pulls back,

[429] 2170.44s - 2176.62s
we watch those Fibo levels

[430] 2177.80s - 2183.14s
to see where it might bounce.

[431] 2185.00s - 2190.30s
If it bounces at 38.2% or 50%,

[432] 2191.64s - 2193.80s
that's a shallow pullback.

[433] 2194.62s - 2198.16s
If it goes to 61.8%,

[434] 2199.82s - 2203.28s
that's a deeper pullback.

[435] 2204.08s - 2207.30s
If it breaks 61.8%,

[436] 2208.18s - 2211.52s
the trend might be weakening.

[437] 2212.22s - 2214.06s
In a downtrend, we do the opposite.

[438] 2215.20s - 2218.46s
Draw from High to Low.

[439] 2218.76s - 2220.10s
Then watch for Resistance when it bounces.

[440] 2222.28s - 2227.96s
Let's see an example.

[441] 2231.30s - 2235.00s
Here's an uptrend.

[442] 2235.00s - 2240.72s
We draw Fibo from Low to High.

[443] 2241.56s - 2245.92s
Click the Fibo tool,

[444] 2245.92s - 2248.64s
click at the Low,

[445] 2248.64s - 2252.20s
drag to the High.

[446] 2252.20s - 2270.70s
There, we get the levels.

[447] 2272.24s - 2275.30s
Now watch when price pulls back,

[448] 2276.40s - 2282.38s
where does it bounce?

[449] 2284.18s - 2285.46s
Look, it bounces right at 50%.

[450] 2287.06s - 2287.66s
like this tail

[451] 2289.08s - 2290.72s
they allow you to draw it like this

[452] 2291.20s - 2294.34s
you can draw the trendline because this is a swing point, see? Price came down then went up

[453] 2294.62s - 2295.56s
came down and went up

[454] 2296.50s - 2299.18s
so you're allowed to draw and test it, because it's like

[455] 2299.18s - 2301.74s
it's a scare candle, reversed back down...

[456] 2301.98s - 2306.40s
went up, there's still no closing price that went beyond this line downward

[457] 2306.74s - 2309.72s
this is what we call discretionary, acceptable

[458] 2311.56s - 2312.74s
something like this is acceptable

[459] 2312.74s - 2315.74s
looks like it'll break through the trendline upward

[460] 2316.26s - 2317.56s
but it didn't actually break

[461] 2318.50s - 2319.02s
see, it wicked up

[462] 2319.78s - 2323.98s
then reversed back down

[463] 2324.52s - 2328.62s
so this is considered

[464] 2328.62s - 2331.20s
acceptable, within discretion

[465] 2331.20s - 2336.66s
But if it clearly breaks through

[466] 2336.66s - 2343.78s
like breaking way up here

[467] 2344.44s - 2345.82s
then coming back down

[468] 2346.30s - 2352.58s
that wouldn't count anymore

[469] 2352.58s - 2355.88s
understand?

[470] 2356.56s - 2360.12s
So this is

[471] 2360.24s - 2364.00s
the trendline concept

[472] 2365.30s - 2371.20s
Drawing trendlines is about

[473] 2371.20s - 2377.14s
finding swing points

[474] 2377.78s - 2383.24s
When you connect swing points

[475] 2383.60s - 2389.20s
you get a trendline

[476] 2389.20s - 2391.90s
Once you have a trendline, you can

[477] 2392.66s - 2397.40s
use it to analyze price movement

[478] 2397.40s - 2401.28s
Like we'll wait for price to test this line

[479] 2401.68s - 2412.34s
when it comes to test

[480] 2412.34s - 2414.50s
if it bounces, we can trade it

[481] 2415.08s - 2418.48s
or wait for it to break through

[482] 2419.34s - 2422.78s
if it breaks, we trade the breakout

[483] 2422.78s - 2424.98s
That's how we use trendlines

[484] 2426.84s - 2428.98s
Next, let's look at

[485] 2430.22s - 2442.32s
channels

[486] 2443.50s - 2449.22s
Channels are drawn by

[487] 2449.22s - 2458.94s
taking the trendline concept

[488] 2460.28s - 2462.58s
and adding a parallel line

[489] 2462.58s - 2469.34s
Like when we have an uptrend

[490] 2469.92s - 2476.84s
we draw the trendline at the bottom

[491] 2476.84s - 2485.14s
connecting swing lows

[492] 2493.80s - 2502.50s
Then we draw a parallel line

[493] 2504.78s - 2511.20s
at the swing highs

[494] 2511.20s - 2512.28s
This creates a channel

[495] 2520.28s - 2523.94s
Price moves within this channel

[496] 2526.64s - 2530.78s
bouncing between the upper and lower lines

[497] 2530.78s - 2538.22s
When we see a channel like this

[498] 2538.22s - 2542.10s
we can trade it

[499] 2543.88s - 2550.38s
Buy at the lower line

[500] 2550.38s - 2556.76s
sell at the upper line

[501] 2557.58s - 2567.54s
or wait for a breakout

[502] 2568.32s - 2578.66s
If price breaks above the channel

[503] 2578.66s - 2589.50s
that's a bullish breakout

[504] 2590.68s - 2598.16s
If it breaks below

[505] 2602.16s - 2611.02s
that's a bearish breakout

[506] 2611.36s - 2616.06s
Let's look at an example

[507] 2616.66s - 2619.56s
Here's a clear uptrend channel

[508] 2619.98s - 2625.46s
See how price

[509] 2625.46s - 2628.58s
keeps bouncing between the lines

[510] 2628.58s - 2631.96s
touches the bottom line

[511] 2632.78s - 2636.98s
bounces up

[512] 2638.00s - 2638.78s
goes to the top line

[513] 2641.58s - 2646.20s
bounces down

[514] 2646.98s - 2649.64s
This creates a trading range

[515] 2651.66s - 2652.50s
within the channel

[516] 2653.40s - 2656.06s
We can use this to plan our trades

[517] 2656.84s - 2660.70s
When price comes to the bottom

[518] 2660.70s - 2664.06s
we look for buy signals

[519] 2664.18s - 2669.66s
When it reaches the top

[520] 2669.68s - 2673.88s
we look for sell signals

[521] 2673.88s - 2678.50s
or take profit

[522] 2678.84s - 2682.10s
Now let's see

[523] 2683.86s - 2687.72s
a downtrend channel

[524] 2690.64s - 2694.44s
In a downtrend

[525] 2695.28s - 2699.00s
we draw the trendline at the top

[526] 2699.68s - 2704.14s
connecting swing highs

[527] 2704.86s - 2712.56s
Then add a parallel line

[528] 2712.86s - 2716.48s
at the swing lows

[529] 2718.44s - 2722.68s
Price moves down within this channel

[530] 2722.94s - 2730.68s
Same concept, just inverted

[531] 2738.60s - 2746.36s
We can sell at the top line

[532] 2748.64s - 2753.88s
buy back at the bottom line

[533] 2756.78s - 2762.82s
or wait for a breakout

[534] 2765.04s - 2770.34s
The key thing about channels is

[535] 2770.92s - 2774.12s
they help us see

[536] 2774.46s - 2780.96s
the range price is moving in

[537] 2780.96s - 2800.32s
and plan our entries and exits

[538] 2800.32s - 2805.46s
Now an important point

[539] 2805.46s - 2807.52s
about drawing channels

[540] 2809.08s - 2813.60s
Sometimes you'll see

[541] 2814.98s - 2819.04s
the channel isn't perfect

[542] 2819.38s - 2824.84s
Price might wick outside

[543] 2824.84s - 2828.76s
but not close outside

[544] 2828.76s - 2833.42s
That's still okay

[545] 2833.64s - 2840.48s
We use discretion here too

[546] 2841.16s - 2845.22s
As long as the closes

[547] 2846.68s - 2847.62s
stay within the channel

[548] 2851.22s - 2852.10s
we can still consider it valid

[549] 2852.46s - 2855.20s
Just like with trendlines

[550] 2852.46s - 2855.20s
If we explain the theory in detail, it'd be really long

[551] 2856.90s - 2859.52s
It's one of the

[552] 2859.52s - 2864.24s
technical tools

[553] 2864.84s - 2869.42s
that acts as psychological Support

[554] 2869.42s - 2873.26s
It has specific ratios

[555] 2873.26s - 2876.98s
The important ones are these

[556] 2877.32s - 2879.84s
38.2%, 50%, and 61.8%

[557] 2881.50s - 2883.88s
So when price moves up

[558] 2885.30s - 2888.90s
If it pulls back, there are 3 lines

[559] 2888.90s - 2892.36s
where price has a chance to bounce as Support or Resistance levels from Fibo

[560] 2892.90s - 2896.52s
So let's say price moves up like this

[561] 2896.98s - 2900.76s
When it pulls back

[562] 2900.76s - 2902.46s
It might bounce at 38.2%

[563] 2902.76s - 2909.26s
or 50%

[564] 2911.14s - 2914.44s
or 61.8%

[565] 2915.48s - 2918.98s
These are considered

[566] 2918.98s - 2922.84s
psychological levels

[567] 2924.06s - 2930.04s
that traders pay attention to

[568] 2931.10s - 2933.86s
It's like

[569] 2935.50s - 2939.84s
when price reaches these Fibonacci levels

[570] 2941.04s - 2944.28s
traders will watch to see if it'll bounce or break through

[571] 2944.98s - 2949.32s
But this is just a tool

[572] 2949.66s - 2955.00s
We still need to combine it with other things we've learned

[573] 2955.00s - 2958.82s
like candlestick patterns

[574] 2959.40s - 2962.44s
price structure

[575] 2962.90s - 2965.84s
to confirm

[576] 2966.74s - 2970.00s
whether it'll really bounce at that level or not

[577] 2970.00s - 2973.54s
Alright, so Fibonacci

[578] 2974.82s - 2976.00s
is one popular tool

[579] 2980.68s - 2984.28s
that many traders use

[580] 2984.28s - 2988.40s
Okay, next

[581] 2989.80s - 2993.64s
We'll talk about Trendlines

[582] 2994.30s - 2996.60s
Trendlines

[583] 2998.08s - 3006.74s
are lines we draw

[584] 3006.74s - 3010.94s
to connect price swing points

[585] 3010.94s - 3014.58s
For an uptrend

[586] 3016.14s - 3018.32s
we connect the lows

[587] 3020.28s - 3023.58s
the bottom points

[588] 3023.96s - 3026.08s
When we draw a line connecting them

[589] 3026.08s - 3030.58s
it becomes an uptrend line

[590] 3031.16s - 3033.22s
For a downtrend

[591] 3033.92s - 3034.92s
we connect the highs

[592] 3040.60s - 3043.14s
the top points

[593] 3043.90s - 3050.98s
When price comes to test this line

[594] 3050.98s - 3058.96s
it often bounces

[595] 3058.96s - 3064.86s
So the trendline acts as Support or Resistance

[596] 3065.22s - 3068.42s
For example, if we draw an uptrend line

[597] 3068.42s - 3074.16s
Each time price pulls back to touch this line

[598] 3075.08s - 3079.56s
it tends to bounce up

[599] 3079.56s - 3084.32s
If it breaks through this trendline

[600] 3084.32s - 3086.34s
it signals that the trend might be changing

[601] 3088.82s - 3092.48s
might be weakening

[602] 3092.48s - 3096.72s
So trendlines

[603] 3096.72s - 3101.32s
are very important tools

[604] 3101.54s - 3108.36s
for identifying trend direction

[605] 3109.78s - 3112.64s
and finding entry points

[606] 3112.88s - 3115.14s
Okay, next we have Channels

[607] 3115.14s - 3116.82s
Channels

[608] 3117.34s - 3119.68s
are when we draw parallel lines

[609] 3120.48s - 3122.32s
both top and bottom

[610] 3122.32s - 3124.74s
The bottom line is Support

[611] 3125.94s - 3127.50s
The top line is Resistance

[612] 3129.08s - 3131.40s
Price will oscillate

[613] 3132.38s - 3141.14s
bounce between these two lines

[614] 3141.14s - 3149.62s
When it hits the bottom, it bounces up

[615] 3150.44s - 3156.92s
When it hits the top, it bounces down

[616] 3157.26s - 3162.52s
This is called trading in a channel

[617] 3162.52s - 3169.44s
If price breaks out of the channel

[618] 3179.62s - 3182.78s
either breaking the top resistance

[619] 3183.06s - 3186.74s
or breaking the bottom support

[620] 3189.66s - 3194.64s
it signals a potential trend change

[621] 3195.02s - 3199.02s
or strong momentum in that direction

[622] 3200.04s - 3206.54s
So channels

[623] 3230.18s - 3235.98s
are great for range trading

[624] 3236.72s - 3241.46s
buying at support, selling at resistance

[625] 3242.50s - 3248.06s
Alright, these are the basic tools

[626] 3248.44s - 3251.28s
for finding Support and Resistance

[627] 3253.36s - 3258.16s
Whether it's horizontal levels

[628] 3259.30s - 3287.62s
Fibonacci retracement

[629] 3288.16s - 3290.04s
Trendlines

[630] 3290.04s - 3296.54s
or Channels

[631] 3296.54s - 3302.96s
They all serve the same purpose

[632] 3304.18s - 3309.58s
helping us find where price might

[633] 3311.12s - 3314.70s
bounce or reverse

[634] 3316.44s - 3318.22s
But remember

[635] 3319.10s - 3321.04s
these aren't 100% accurate

[636] 3321.88s - 3325.28s
Sometimes price breaks through

[637] 3326.44s - 3329.70s
Sometimes it bounces

[638] 3329.70s - 3331.56s
We need to combine them with

[639] 3331.56s - 3335.20s
candlestick patterns

[640] 3335.20s - 3339.44s
price structure

[641] 3339.44s - 3343.24s
and other confirmations

[642] 3343.24s - 3347.06s
to make better trading decisions

[643] 3347.06s - 3361.54s
Don't rely on just one tool

[644] 3361.54s - 3365.52s
Use multiple confirmations

[645] 3365.52s - 3370.02s
That'll increase our probability of success

[646] 3370.16s - 3372.34s
Okay, now let's look at

[647] 3372.34s - 3377.30s
some real chart examples

[648] 3377.30s - 3384.86s
so you can see how these work in practice

[649] 3384.86s - 3389.18s
Here we can see

[650] 3390.78s - 3395.54s
This is a clear uptrend

[651] 3396.12s - 3400.12s
Price keeps making higher highs

[652] 3401.82s - 3407.22s
and higher lows

[653] 3412.68s - 3418.92s
If we draw a trendline

[654] 3419.78s - 3425.88s
connecting these lows

[655] 3433.90s - 3442.28s
You'll see price respects this line

[656] 3452.76s - 3455.66s
Each pullback touches the trendline and bounces

[657] 3455.66s - 3455.86s
This shows the trend is still strong

[658] 3455.88s - 3456.72s
But look here

[659] 3459.62s - 3461.76s
When price breaks below the trendline

[660] 3463.46s - 3464.48s
it signals trend weakness

[661] 3465.84s - 3467.58s
After the break, price starts moving sideways

[662] 3468.04s - 3469.52s
or even reverses

[663] 3473.22s - 3473.84s
So trendline breaks

[664] 3474.78s - 3475.22s
are important signals to watch

[665] 3476.16s - 3477.90s
Here's another example

[666] 3481.98s - 3482.48s
This is a channel

[667] 3485.18s - 3485.86s
Price is bouncing between

[668] 3485.86s - 3512.98s
the upper resistance line

[669] 3514.90s - 3520.12s
and the lower support line

[670] 3520.94s - 3534.44s
Each time it touches the bottom, it bounces up

[671] 3539.62s - 3550.96s
Each time it touches the top, it bounces down

[672] 3552.24s - 3555.58s
Very clear pattern

[673] 3555.58s - 3559.90s
If we trade this channel

[674] 3561.02s - 3566.32s
we'd buy near the bottom support

[675] 3566.76s - 3571.64s
and sell near the top resistance

[676] 3571.86s - 3574.88s
But watch what happens here

[677] 3575.22s - 3579.04s
Price breaks above the channel

[678] 3580.16s - 3585.34s
That's a breakout signal

[679] 3585.34s - 3586.94s
After breaking out, price continues moving strongly upward

[680] 3588.40s - 3592.18s
This is why channel breakouts

[681] 3592.18s - 3595.08s
are important trading opportunities

[682] 3596.10s - 3603.58s
Now let's look at Fibonacci

[683] 3604.66s - 3613.70s
Here price made a strong move up

[684] 3615.72s - 3623.90s
Then it started pulling back

[685] 3625.62s - 3628.28s
If we draw Fibonacci from the low to the high

[686] 3628.76s - 3630.76s
We can see the retracement levels

[687] 3631.26s - 3634.18s
Look here, price pulled back

[688] 3634.18s - 3636.84s
and bounced right at the 61.8% level

[689] 3637.64s - 3641.62s
This is a common Fibo level

[690] 3642.18s - 3643.82s
where price often finds support

[691] 3645.88s - 3647.58s
After bouncing at 61.8%

[692] 3647.58s - 3650.02s
price continued moving up

[693] 3650.02s - 3652.98s
resuming the uptrend

[694] 3653.46s - 3656.22s
This shows how Fibonacci levels

[695] 3656.22s - 3658.84s
can help us find good entry points

[696] 3658.84s - 3661.78s
during pullbacks in a trend

[697] 3661.78s - 3664.64s
Alright, so these are practical examples

[698] 3664.64s - 3669.50s
of how to use these tools

[699] 3669.50s - 3674.46s
Now you can practice finding these patterns

[700] 3679.14s - 3682.36s
can't break through, meaning it can't push higher

[701] 3682.36s - 3686.90s
So here we might think, well, it might not make it

[702] 3687.54s - 3691.80s
Maybe it'll drop back down first? Let's wait and see? Or what?

[703] 3692.16s - 3694.92s
But we see another candlestick trying to break through

[704] 3694.92s - 3698.32s
Alright, so when it breaks through, we see the role switches

[705] 3699.28s - 3702.72s
from what was Resistance, now acting as Support

[706] 3703.86s - 3710.48s
See? When it breaks through, the role reverses

[707] 3710.48s - 3715.58s
supporting from below

[708] 3715.58s - 3719.08s
Then it bounces up again

[709] 3719.42s - 3725.16s
continuing the upward move

[710] 3725.16s - 3730.36s
Alright, so this shows how Support and Resistance

[711] 3730.36s - 3733.94s
can switch roles

[712] 3733.94s - 3736.28s
This concept is very important

[713] 3738.08s - 3740.90s
for understanding price movement

[714] 3741.82s - 3743.16s
Now let's look at another example

[715] 3743.46s - 3744.42s
This one combines multiple concepts

[716] 3745.56s - 3747.92s
Here we have a trendline

[717] 3748.52s - 3751.28s
which is diagonal Support

[718] 3752.20s - 3753.92s
The price keeps testing this line

[719] 3754.26s - 3756.44s
bouncing up each time

[720] 3757.30s - 3759.48s
This shows the trendline is strong

[721] 3759.48s - 3762.06s
because it's been tested multiple times

[722] 3762.06s - 3767.74s
Now look what happens when it breaks

[723] 3767.74s - 3771.28s
The trendline switches from Support

[724] 3772.26s - 3777.38s
to become Resistance

[725] 3777.56s - 3778.22s
See how the price tries to go back up

[726] 3780.12s - 3785.04s
but gets rejected at the old trendline

[727] 3785.26s - 3791.48s
This is a perfect example of role reversal

[728] 3791.48s - 3794.84s
The same line that was supporting

[729] 3794.84s - 3798.20s
is now resisting

[730] 3798.20s - 3802.24s
Alright, let's talk about channels

[731] 3803.38s - 3815.02s
A channel has two parallel lines

[732] 3815.02s - 3819.86s
The lower line is Support

[733] 3819.86s - 3825.42s
The upper line is Resistance

[734] 3825.42s - 3831.76s
The price moves between these two lines

[735] 3831.76s - 3836.34s
bouncing from Support to Resistance

[736] 3837.40s - 3866.32s
and back down again

[737] 3866.32s - 3868.76s
This is called channel trading

[738] 3868.76s - 3873.98s
When the price is at the bottom

[739] 3874.90s - 3878.98s
touching Support, we can buy

[740] 3881.18s - 3882.38s
When it reaches the top

[741] 3884.50s - 3886.78s
touching Resistance, we can sell

[742] 3887.56s - 3890.84s
This works as long as the channel holds

[743] 3891.62s - 3894.18s
But what happens if it breaks out?

[744] 3894.92s - 3897.58s
If it breaks above the upper line

[745] 3898.26s - 3899.50s
that Resistance becomes Support

[746] 3899.50s - 3902.32s
The same role reversal concept

[747] 3902.32s - 3903.98s
we've been talking about

[748] 3904.80s - 3908.36s
Now, there's one more thing

[749] 3908.58s - 3914.24s
about Support and Resistance zones

[750] 3914.24s - 3918.34s
Remember, we don't draw them as single lines

[751] 3918.70s - 3924.90s
We draw them as zones or areas

[752] 3927.16s - 3941.90s
Because the price doesn't respect exact levels

[753] 3941.90s - 3952.04s
It moves in zones

[754] 3953.94s - 3963.02s
So when you're drawing Support and Resistance

[755] 3964.80s - 3967.20s
don't try to be too precise

[756] 3969.08s - 3972.74s
Draw zones instead

[757] 3973.74s - 3977.68s
This gives you more flexibility

[758] 3977.68s - 3982.08s
and better accuracy

[759] 3982.48s - 3987.00s
Alright, let's look at some practical examples

[760] 3988.22s - 3996.96s
on real charts

[761] 3997.56s - 4007.94s
Here's a chart showing horizontal Support

[762] 4014.28s - 4020.80s
You can see the price bouncing multiple times

[763] 4020.80s - 4026.38s
from this zone

[764] 4026.38s - 4030.48s
Each bounce makes the Support stronger

[765] 4030.48s - 4033.88s
because more traders recognize it

[766] 4033.88s - 4038.04s
Now look at this Resistance zone

[767] 4038.34s - 4042.94s
The price tries to break through

[768] 4046.34s - 4053.34s
but gets pushed back down

[769] 4054.20s - 4059.68s
several times

[770] 4060.02s - 4067.80s
This shows the Resistance is strong

[771] 4069.10s - 4078.04s
Until finally, it breaks through

[772] 4082.78s - 4085.22s
with a strong bullish candlestick

[773] 4091.00s - 4095.28s
Now watch what happens next

[774] 4095.72s - 4098.44s
The price pulls back

[775] 4099.14s - 4103.32s
to retest the old Resistance

[776] 4103.50s - 4108.42s
which is now acting as Support

[777] 4108.42s - 4110.58s
This is a classic retest pattern

[778] 4113.04s - 4116.16s
and a great trading opportunity

[779] 4117.50s - 4120.24s
If you see a Pinbar here

[780] 4120.56s - 4124.24s
at the old Resistance turned Support

[781] 4124.24s - 4126.66s
that's a high-probability setup

[782] 4126.66s - 4128.98s
combining candlestick patterns with Support and Resistance

[783] 4130.50s - 4132.94s
This is what we call confluence

[784] 4134.20s - 4137.70s
when multiple signals line up

[785] 4137.70s - 4144.84s
Alright, so to summarize

[786] 4144.84s - 4147.72s
Support and Resistance are price zones

[787] 4147.72s - 4153.72s
not exact lines

[788] 4154.42s - 4159.66s
They can switch roles when broken

[789] 4159.66s - 4164.50s
Support becomes Resistance

[790] 4164.50s - 4167.02s
Resistance becomes Support

[791] 4167.02s - 4172.00s
The more times a level is tested

[792] 4173.50s - 4176.30s
the stronger it becomes

[793] 4176.30s - 4181.72s
We can use them with candlestick patterns

[794] 4181.72s - 4185.28s
for better trading decisions

[795] 4185.28s - 4189.24s
Support and Resistance work on all timeframes

[796] 4189.24s - 4193.92s
from 1-minute charts to monthly charts

[797] 4193.92s - 4197.80s
The concept is the same

[798] 4197.80s - 4202.14s
just on different scales

[799] 4202.14s - 4205.80s
Now, when you're analyzing charts

[800] 4205.80s - 4209.26s
start with higher timeframes first

[801] 4209.26s - 4215.46s
like weekly or 4-hour charts

[802] 4215.90s - 4220.44s
to find the major Support and Resistance zones

[803] 4221.86s - 4225.52s
Then drill down to lower timeframes

[804] 4225.52s - 4229.32s
to find your entry points

[805] 4229.32s - 4232.92s
This top-down approach

[806] 4232.92s - 4235.10s
gives you better perspective

[807] 4235.10s - 4240.64s
of the overall market structure

[808] 4241.74s - 4244.42s
Alright, we've covered a lot today

[809] 4247.40s - 4252.94s
about Support and Resistance

[810] 4252.94s - 4254.22s
This is Part 2 of Price Action

[811] 4256.40s - 4260.90s
In Part 1, we learned about candlesticks

[812] 4260.90s - 4266.14s
Now in Part 2, we've learned Support and Resistance

[813] 4267.14s - 4273.46s
These two components together

[814] 4273.46s - 4277.96s
form the foundation of Price Action trading

[815] 4277.96s - 4282.64s
When you combine candlestick patterns

[816] 4282.64s - 4285.06s
with Support and Resistance zones

[817] 4285.06s - 4290.44s
you'll have a powerful trading system

[818] 4291.50s - 4296.56s
The key is to practice

[819] 4296.56s - 4299.96s
looking at many charts

[820] 4302.04s - 4305.44s
identifying these levels

[821] 4305.44s - 4309.98s
and watching how price reacts

[822] 4309.98s - 4326.54s
Over time, you'll develop

[823] 4326.54s - 4330.76s
an eye for these patterns

[824] 4330.76s - 4334.10s
and you'll start recognizing them quickly

[825] 4334.34s - 4336.92s
Remember, Support and Resistance

[826] 4336.92s - 4340.32s
are the most important tools in Price Action

[827] 4340.32s - 4345.70s
and when you find these simple patterns, that's it

[828] 4345.70s - 4348.56s
there's consistent profit opportunity

[829] 4349.34s - 4350.58s
Thank you very much. Goodbye.
