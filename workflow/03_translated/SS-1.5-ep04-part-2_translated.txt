================================================================================

[Segment 1] 2.160s → 10.000s
Now we've reached the next topic, the next episode, which is about Sideways markets.

[Segment 2] 10.520s → 18.000s
Normally price goes up like this, then it consolidates like this, then continues, then changes to go down.

[Segment 3] 18.540s → 21.840s
The cycle will be something like this.

[Segment 4] 22.040s → 26.080s
Before this, we already learned about reversals.

[Segment 5] 26.440s → 30.360s
Those points there are reversal points.

[Segment 6] 30.700s → 35.180s
Now we're going to learn about Sideways, this period here.

[Segment 7] 35.700s → 40.440s
During Sideways, will it go up? Or from Sideways will it go down?

[Segment 8] 40.880s → 42.620s
It can change either way.

[Segment 9] 43.060s → 48.860s
It's not that if it's Sideways and it's in an uptrend, it must continue up. It could go down too.

[Segment 10] 49.260s → 55.580s
Now let's look at how we analyze candlesticks, the conditions of the balance scale.

[Segment 11] 55.580s → 59.580s
The price balance scale, Action and Reaction, how does it work?

[Segment 12] 60.340s → 62.180s
Let me erase this first.

[Segment 13] 63.020s → 69.880s
Now let's look at the easy analysis of Action Reaction in Sideways markets.

[Segment 14] 70.300s → 76.640s
Before this, here was an uptrend coming up like this, which we already looked at.

[Segment 15] 77.320s → 80.580s
This part is different, it's a different chart from yesterday.

[Segment 16] 81.140s → 87.920s
Now we're going to look at the part where it went up and then consolidated Sideways. What happens next after Sideways?

[Segment 17] 88.400s → 89.420s
Let's take a look.

[Segment 18] 89.740s → 97.320s
Right now I've drawn the support level approximately at these points here, understanding that support is an area.

[Segment 19] 97.320s → 100.000s
It's an area, not a single thin line.

[Segment 20] 100.620s → 103.460s
Not a single line like this, support can't be like that.

[Segment 21] 103.840s → 107.820s
It has to be an area, a range.

[Segment 22] 108.660s → 113.440s
Check here, it held and didn't go down. Here it was resisted.

[Segment 23] 114.080s → 121.180s
So this is an area that has density or is like a wall of price that blocks it.

[Segment 24] 121.920s → 126.100s
Or it's like a barrier, as we've learned, that it can't pass through yet.

[Segment 25] 126.480s → 130.900s
Because once it passes through, it will continue like this.

[Segment 26] 131.440s → 136.080s
Now let's say we don't know about this part yet, that it's going to be Sideways.

[Segment 27] 136.680s → 139.640s
Let's look. Now we'll get the axis.

[Segment 28] 140.020s → 142.440s
The balance scale axis, here it is.

[Segment 29] 142.680s → 144.560s
The balance scale axis is here.

[Segment 30] 144.980s → 147.780s
Now what else are we going to look at?

[Segment 31] 148.260s → 153.160s
We get the highest price point here, closed at this point.

[Segment 32] 153.760s → 159.360s
Then we look at the left side and right side, which is Action and Reaction.

[Segment 33] 160.380s → 163.300s
We have the center axis now, right?

[Segment 34] 163.780s → 166.460s
The center axis of the balance scale, remember?

[Segment 35] 167.140s → 169.240s
From the previous lessons, we need to have the center axis first.

[Segment 36] 169.840s → 172.680s
Then we can measure the force, like this.

[Segment 37] 173.740s → 177.040s
On this side that's bearish, we get this one.

[Segment 38] 177.720s → 180.040s
Draw it here. Does this side exceed half?

[Segment 39] 180.440s → 183.000s
Half would be about here.

[Segment 40] 183.400s → 187.820s
So this exceeds half of the axis.

[Segment 41] 188.040s → 191.860s
So does this candle count? Yes, it counts. And is it a lot? Yes, a lot.

[Segment 42] 192.300s → 195.480s
See how it won going up like this?

[Segment 43] 195.880s → 203.080s
So after we see this, it means price has a chance to consolidate, which means pull back down because it's quite strong.

[Segment 44] 203.480s → 205.720s
It went way beyond, a lot.

[Segment 45] 206.280s → 213.560s
Now if we look at it with Momentum from Season 1, see? It had force pushing up to here then contracted back down.

[Segment 46] 214.100s → 215.080s
Ending like this.

[Segment 47] 215.480s → 218.340s
This is selling pressure, selling pressure pushing down.

[Segment 48] 218.780s → 221.540s
Very clear, the red side.

[Segment 49] 222.020s → 225.040s
This candle got hit down, getting ready to reverse.

[Segment 50] 225.520s → 230.360s
And the next candle opened and followed down again like this.


[Segment 51] 300.100s → 302.420s
This is the highest point, so we'll count this one.

[Segment 52] 302.540s → 323.340s
Actually we count this one. Whatever happens, we don't care about other price points.

[Segment 53] 323.340s → 327.360s
And then swing up again. This one is the axis. Let's look again and adjust the line.

[Segment 54] 328.620s → 329.860s
Here, the axis is here.

[Segment 55] 330.420s → 333.520s
This is Action, this is Reaction.

[Segment 56] 334.940s → 337.740s
Very close, but it looks like Reaction loses slightly.

[Segment 57] 338.380s → 342.420s
So price can't go lower than this yet.

[Segment 58] 342.420s → 347.160s
It consolidates further, see? It can't win all at once.

[Segment 59] 347.600s → 351.940s
This set compared to this set has less, I mean the force is decreasing.

[Segment 60] 351.940s → 355.440s
Reaction is decreasing. So this much isn't enough yet.

[Segment 61] 355.440s → 372.400s
It can't finish going down in one go. This one is even less.

[Segment 62] 372.560s → 378.480s
And we need to find the next one, the highest one of the later group that swung up after Sideways.

[Segment 63] 378.480s → 382.800s
Which one is it? There are many. If finding the highest, it's this one.

[Segment 64] 384.360s → 390.600s
This line, and stick it at the boundary like before, at the Body.

[Segment 65] 391.000s → 397.860s
And find the Action Reaction sides. This is Action, see? Right here.

[Segment 66] 398.620s → 402.600s
Does this side have more? Has more, this one. Still small.

[Segment 67] 402.600s → 406.940s
Force is still small, not enough yet. Resistance first. See?

[Segment 68] 406.940s → 409.120s
This side, evenly matched. So can it go down?

[Segment 69] 409.120s → 414.420s
Not down yet. Price went up here, came down, still not down.

[Segment 70] 415.440s → 420.820s
Up again, up again.

[Segment 71] 420.880s → 423.920s
Let's find it. These 3, which one is highest? This one.

[Segment 72] 425.200s → 429.280s
It's this one, then adjust here again. It'll be at its Body.

[Segment 73] 429.640s → 431.640s
About here.

[Segment 74] 432.400s → 436.140s
So which Action do we get that exceeds half?

[Segment 75] 436.420s → 439.000s
Exceeds half. Zoom in and look.

[Segment 76] 439.980s → 444.460s
Here, here.

[Segment 77] 446.240s → 448.740s
See this?

[Segment 78] 449.360s → 452.060s
This one exceeds half. Exceeds half, count from the Body.

[Segment 79] 452.060s → 455.220s
Don't count this one. This one, see how it exceeds half?

[Segment 80] 455.860s → 459.500s
Here, count placing right here to fit perfectly, perfectly.

[Segment 81] 462.160s → 463.960s
Exceeds half here. So count this.

[Segment 82] 463.960s → 469.140s
As Action on this side. This side is about here.

[Segment 83] 469.140s → 472.880s
And Reaction? This doesn't exceed, see? Doesn't.

[Segment 84] 473.800s → 479.320s
Here, does it? This is about half, this one. Does it have force yet?

[Segment 85] 479.900s → 482.560s
Does this have force? No, no force, no force. This one has force again.

[Segment 86] 482.560s → 486.300s
See? To push it down. So price ended up running down.

[Segment 87] 487.200s → 490.920s
Remember that if it gets it, we have to keep counting.

[Segment 88] 491.440s → 497.700s
Here, it will run like this. See? Like what we've been doing.

[Segment 89] 499.840s → 508.440s
Look, this Low here, it went up here, right? What we just counted is still Low.

[Segment 90] 508.440s → 511.960s
And went up here. This is Sideways, see? It's Sideways for a while.

[Segment 91] 512.460s → 518.160s
And do you see anything? That the old Low is here, and here the Reaction force, this one.

[Segment 92] 518.520s → 523.660s
This one wins, so it must be lower than this Low, right? Must be lower. See?

[Segment 93] 524.040s → 527.860s
In the end it came down lower like this.

[Segment 94] 529.600s → 531.620s
This one got it slightly.

[Segment 95] 532.520s → 538.260s
See? In the end it broke lower. Won this much.

[Segment 96] 538.260s → 541.380s
It doesn't say here wins, then after Sideways it will win this one.

[Segment 97] 541.560s → 544.400s
Or come to this one. You have to gradually look step by step.

[Segment 98] 545.080s → 548.560s
Like this, now this is the latest Low. It will win the latest Low, then come down.

[Segment 99] 549.460s → 552.200s
Then up again. If you see this as a level already.

[Segment 100] 552.200s → 555.240s
It becomes resistance, see?

[Segment 101] 556.900s → 559.320s
And slide over like this.

[Segment 102] 561.200s → 564.280s
But now we need to look at its force too.

[Segment 103] 564.780s → 567.540s
We've been looking at the force here for a long time.

[Segment 104] 567.740s → 573.320s
For a long time, this is the very first point where price ran up and we said it must.

[Segment 105] 573.320s → 576.760s
Here it already told us that price must win this point, so we won't.

[Segment 106] 576.760s → 581.620s
Come look at this to find if it must win here. That's a different matter.

[Segment 107] 581.620s → 586.260s
This one has to win the Low in its own Sideways section, in its own group.

[Segment 108] 586.260s → 587.500s
Which is its Low, which is this one here.

[Segment 109] 589.340s → 591.120s
This is the latest Low. If it wins, it's this one.

[Segment 110] 591.600s → 594.320s
But this one already said it must come down anyway.

[Segment 111] 594.320s → 596.840s
So it's the long-term picture that this one tells. It just might not happen at this time immediately.

[Segment 112] 597.380s → 599.820s
But this Sideways, in the end it will have a story.

[Segment 113] 599.820s → 602.540s
See? It will have a story at each point saying whether it succeeds or not, going on and on.

[Segment 114] 602.540s → 604.800s
Until it meets a point where it succeeds.

[Segment 115] 604.800s → 611.480s
Measure at this one. Action, put the line here like this.

[Segment 116] 611.480s → 624.280s
Run up. This is Action. Came down.

[Segment 117] 624.280s → 632.260s
Action is about here. Which side is Reaction?

[Segment 118] 633.680s → 638.100s
Does this exceed? This one should exceed.

[Segment 119] 638.100s → 645.000s
We'll count this one. Does it become having force? Does it have force?

[Segment 120] 645.640s → 648.940s
No force. Which means it shouldn't pass this.

[Segment 121] 648.940s → 653.760s
See? It shouldn't pass. But in the end it did pass.

[Segment 122] 654.660s → 657.600s
In the end it passed. We already talked about what happens.

[Segment 123] 658.980s → 661.320s
Something that shouldn't happen, like it shouldn't be possible, but it becomes possible.

[Segment 124] 661.320s → 664.620s
In the end there must be a reversal of something.

[Segment 125] 668.820s → 673.440s
Suppose it shouldn't pass, should go down, but it doesn't go down, it continues up.

[Segment 126] 673.740s → 677.240s
That's it. It will come back down lower than now immediately.

[Segment 127] 677.880s → 681.040s
There will be a swing like this, upward swing.

[Segment 128] 687.660s → 693.680s
So downward swing is the same. It comes back to swing like this.

[Segment 129] 693.680s → 702.100s
Simply put, if it's a downtrend, what must it be like?

[Segment 130] 703.240s → 709.560s
Must be, um, should go down already, but it comes back up instead, then it becomes like this.

[Segment 131] 709.560s → 714.160s
Here, shouldn't pass, but it passed, so in the end it reverses and hits back up.

[Segment 132] 715.640s → 718.980s
Wins violently, abnormally. Abnormal like this.

[Segment 133] 718.980s → 723.980s
Becomes a candle like this, higher than this already.

[Segment 134] 724.600s → 727.160s
So this one becomes, it's like this one ran up.

[Segment 135] 727.380s → 736.540s
Swing here, swing. Swing down, swing up.

[Segment 136] 737.560s → 741.740s
So which one do we count? We come back to count this one again, like this.

[Segment 137] 741.740s → 745.900s
See? Find the line down. This side, now there's nothing on Action side.

[Segment 138] 745.900s → 748.620s
No green at all in this Zone. It would have to go far to find this one.

[Segment 139] 748.620s → 752.000s
Which we won't use, right? We don't count going back that far.

[Segment 140] 752.980s → 755.060s
Let's take just about this much. But Reaction came down this much.

[Segment 141] 755.080s → 758.920s
So it already wins. If going to break, it already exceeds anyway.

[Segment 142] 758.920s → 763.480s
It already must break the old Low here anyway.

[Segment 143] 763.480s → 769.080s
Because just this much already exceeds.

[Segment 144] 769.260s → 775.480s
Price swings swings along. In the end it came down.

[Segment 145] 778.020s → 781.200s
And this one already said from the start it must reach this one, at least.

[Segment 146] 781.200s → 785.520s
In the end price came down to here. See?

[Segment 147] 785.520s → 799.060s
This Low here. If we take, if we take this one, take this one out.

[Segment 148] 799.060s → 803.080s
See? It reached here, which is lower. See?

[Segment 149] 803.400s → 805.420s
That here is lower than here. It will be from this one, this set that told us.

[Segment 150] 806.040s → 809.400s
Price came down to here. Now look at this.

[Segment 151] 810.220s → 814.020s
And do you think it will go up here again?

[Segment 152] 814.020s → 818.520s
Will it be like swing down then swing up, uptrend here?

[Segment 153] 819.340s → 821.560s
We have to look again. It's not that it went down, hey, wait here.

[Segment 154] 821.880s → 824.520s
But actually we got the picture from here already.

[Segment 155] 824.520s → 827.140s
Because it must come down about here, which, ah, here actually it already reached.

[Segment 156] 829.340s → 831.840s
This exceeded already too, maybe. Ah, exceeded, see the tail exceeded.

[Segment 157] 832.560s → 834.800s
The tail exceeded already. The tail of this one truly reached here already.

[Segment 158] 834.800s → 840.060s
The result of this one, it reached the tail of this one already.

[Segment 159] 840.060s → 844.360s
Now once it reached, what happened? It's exactly at support.

[Segment 160] 844.360s → 864.780s
This one, as soon as price came down, it immediately bounced back up.

[Segment 161] 864.780s → 868.280s
It might come back up like this. Right?

[Segment 162] 868.280s → 872.040s
It came down to support. The price came down, came to test support from what passed before.

[Segment 163] 872.040s → 877.840s
Test. And might reverse back up again.

[Segment 164] 877.840s → 894.760s
Because here the job was completed successfully already.

[Segment 165] 895.280s → 899.580s
The candlestick set, the balance scale that said here, that the Action and, reached here already.

[Segment 166] 899.580s → 905.700s
A lot. So there's no way it will go up to this High for sure.

[Segment 167] 905.700s → 909.440s
It just goes up up up up. In the end got slapped down because it can't go.

[Segment 168] 909.440s → 924.740s
If reading Momentum it already loses, this set was already losing.

[Segment 169] 924.740s → 928.340s
It's selling pressure already. This, one, two, three, selling pressure.

[Segment 170] 929.000s → 932.740s
Here. Actually it's a line here. It's selling pressure already.

[Segment 171] 932.740s → 937.200s
In Season 2 style reading the future ahead, you already see that it can't go either.

[Segment 172] 937.200s → 943.620s
So everything confirms each other, showing that we're confident we won't trade against it.

[Segment 173] 944.500s → 947.300s
Here it will become a downtrend like this. We don't dare to buy against going up.

[Segment 174] 949.380s → 952.020s
Because it can't go far.

[Segment 175] 953.340s → 958.300s
See? It has, uh, the force here. It came down, it swung came, pa pa pa pa pa.

[Segment 176] 958.300s → 961.300s
To here, this is the lowest. Then it came to receive, swing came like this.

[Segment 177] 962.000s → 973.600s
This is Sideways. It's in a frame.

[Segment 178] 975.200s → 983.300s
If you look, see? Here here here, it's on the downtrend leg like this.

[Segment 179] 984.080s → 986.920s
Here, Sideways like this, right?

[Segment 180] 986.920s → 990.040s
It's just this thick. Let's see, what? Ah, this is green, this one.

[Segment 181] 990.040s → 993.220s
This side is definitely this one, as Action.

[Segment 182] 993.220s → 995.860s
And then this has to be this one. This one. See?

[Segment 183] 999.080s → 1010.300s
At first it was this one. Now it's like this, feels like even worse than before.

[Segment 184] 1010.300s → 1015.080s
Like the force is decreasing even more.

[Segment 185] 1017.380s → 1025.700s
Can't fight, just barely win. The previous High is definitely this one.

[Segment 186] 1026.620s → 1035.240s
Price has no way to come up to this one. Count this one as Action.

[Segment 187] 1037.940s → 1041.680s
This one is Reaction. The force isn't enough.

[Segment 188] 1042.180s → 1044.160s
So when it bounced up here, it can't reach here.

[Segment 189] 1044.520s → 1050.380s
It might come up to about here first.

[Segment 190] 1055.100s → 1062.980s
If it will win here, we already learned that it must do, do what?

[Segment 191] 1062.980s → 1071.300s
Something like this, which is make, refresh the force like this.

[Segment 192] 1071.720s → 1073.540s
Here the force isn't enough for it to go up to win here.

[Segment 193] 1074.080s → 1078.740s
It might have to wait another bit where here there's more force.

[Segment 194] 1078.740s → 1081.060s
Win here and go up, like this.

[Segment 195] 1083.800s → 1089.300s
Then chase up like this again. Which is have to look at Action Reaction points.

[Segment 196] 1091.780s → 1093.080s
Chase step by step up to where it will be able to win.

[Segment 197] 1095.840s → 1099.000s
Here it doesn't win in the near future.

[Segment 198] 1099.800s → 1104.940s
Came up, scroll down to see. It's here right?

[Segment 199] 1105.100s → 1108.660s
Swing up then down. Wait, will there be a higher point than this?

[Segment 200] 1108.660s → 1112.340s
Found a point higher than this, because this point is, it swung like this, might come to this point.

[Segment 201] 1112.340s → 1128.980s
Right? Is there a higher one? Going forward it chased up already.

[Segment 202] 1128.980s → 1134.820s
So now not this point, it must come up to about here.

[Segment 203] 1134.820s → 1137.640s
So it will be this shape. Like price came down like this.

[Segment 204] 1138.780s → 1142.020s
Not quite lined up. We have to come here. Like take this, and come here.

[Segment 205] 1142.240s → 1147.520s
The swing will be like this. So now we'll look.

[Segment 206] 1147.520s → 1153.620s
Suppose it's a swing, erase this first. This one.

[Segment 207] 1153.920s → 1156.940s
The axis comes to here. This is here. This can be used.

[Segment 208] 1156.940s → 1162.520s
So this one has force. It will chase up. Have force.

[Segment 209] 1162.520s → 1166.240s
Then will win this. Because this one if receiving the original.

[Segment 210] 1167.000s → 1170.000s
The area around here, it already won. This is the latest one.

[Segment 211] 1172.340s → 1180.440s
It might be this one. Go up to this, this one. Will it go down?

[Segment 212] 1180.440s → 1186.500s
Scroll and see. Showing that it still goes up.

[Segment 213] 1187.460s → 1192.640s
Not finished yet. Follow it first. Follow it.

[Segment 214] 1193.480s → 1196.180s
Now count this as the axis. Because it went up to here.

[Segment 215] 1196.880s → 1202.840s
Because it hasn't won this one yet, but already won here successfully.

[Segment 216] 1202.840s → 1207.700s
Now here. We'll look again at how far down it will go.

[Segment 217] 1207.700s → 1209.640s
Does it have force to go down? Here is the axis.

[Segment 218] 1212.140s → 1216.460s
This definitely counts. Does this exceed half? About half.

[Segment 219] 1216.720s → 1220.700s
About half. Wait for confirmation. Doesn't have, so this one is half.

[Segment 220] 1220.700s → 1225.140s
Actually it's half. So maybe count this one.

[Segment 221] 1225.140s → 1246.440s
Asking if there's force down? If suppose we count this one, it loses.

[Segment 222] 1246.880s → 1252.200s
Here is the axis. Here. Loses. I mean here.

[Segment 223] 1252.760s → 1257.000s
Here. Loses. So will it be able to come down to this Low or this one?

[Segment 224] 1257.000s → 1262.680s
Not likely that it will go down. So it might go up again.

[Segment 225] 1263.080s → 1268.700s
Wait because it, it doesn't have force to press down to reach this area.

[Segment 226] 1268.740s → 1273.000s
See? It just chases up and this, will it go down? It just slaps slaps slaps up again.

[Segment 227] 1273.000s → 1276.080s
Becomes new. This one went up, down up. So it will become, change to count this one.

[Segment 228] 1276.080s → 1279.880s
Now let's look at this one. Not this one. This one must be the axis.

[Segment 229] 1280.300s → 1298.720s
This one must be the axis. As a new axis. But because after this one ran and came here.

[Segment 230] 1298.720s → 1302.460s
And went up here. This one will become the axis. This one, stick at the axis.

[Segment 231] 1302.460s → 1306.040s
Stick the line. Stick it. Then we find what? Uh, Action Reaction. Get which one?

[Segment 232] 1306.040s → 1311.060s
This one doesn't get it. This one gets it right away. This one gets it.

[Segment 233] 1311.360s → 1314.660s
Here. Make this one clear. Once this one gets it.

[Segment 234] 1314.960s → 1319.840s
We'll see that between this one and this one, this one has more force.

[Segment 235] 1320.160s → 1323.640s
And when comparing sets, compare sets.

[Segment 236] 1323.640s → 1329.900s
Between this one and this set. This set has less force. This set switches sides.

[Segment 237] 1329.900s → 1344.640s
Like the balance scale changed. It changed, showing force increased.

[Segment 238] 1344.640s → 1374.620s
So it will have more force to go down than before. But this one didn't go down much.

[Segment 239] 1374.620s → 1377.700s
It bounced back up to make swing number one. While it's Sideways.

[Segment 240] 1378.020s → 1381.860s
This has a chance to come down. Come down further. Force is quite a lot more.

[Segment 241] 1381.860s → 1387.260s
Because this one is very small. Came back down a lot. If reading.

[Segment 242] 1387.260s → 1391.960s
Reading about bringing Momentum in, or energy in, or measuring force. Got it.

[Segment 243] 1391.960s → 1394.520s
There's a chance to come down more than before. More than before.

[Segment 244] 1404.900s → 1408.000s
And bring other things in as well. Support and resistance.

[Segment 245] 1408.520s → 1410.800s
Forgot that we already learned from theory. It's not that we look at only one thing.

[Segment 246] 1410.800s → 1414.800s
The balance scale, you must look at where it happens. The components must be complete.

[Segment 247] 1415.040s → 1420.340s
Remember? Now where will it be complete? Here. Is it an important level?

[Segment 248] 1421.620s → 1424.320s
Is it resistance? It's resistance. And it's a trendline here.

[Segment 249] 1424.320s → 1427.460s
Very likely, not likely, it's an important position already. It's an important scene.

[Segment 250] 1428.280s → 1429.800s
If we read cartoon style, it's an important scene already. The cast is complete.

[Segment 251] 1429.800s → 1433.780s
It switched from less force to come up, has less force. Can't go down yet.

[Segment 252] 1433.780s → 1437.360s
But came to resistance area, the same. So this time it comes, it still won't go down yet.

[Segment 253] 1437.900s → 1440.940s
It goes on. Close to each other already. Around the resistance area like this.

[Segment 254] 1440.940s → 1445.460s
That day there's a chance to come down. Normally from Price Action, it also...

[Segment 255] 1446.720s → 1452.260s
This resistance. If it's Sideways down, right? It must come.

[Segment 256] 1453.080s → 1457.420s
Next receive is receive here. Or receive at the horizontal level.

[Segment 257] 1459.160s → 1462.380s
Whichever. Now we'll look. Gradually came down. Because its force is more, see?

[Segment 258] 1462.380s → 1465.980s
Here is the swing of bouncing back. Will it bounce back past this resistance?

[Segment 259] 1465.980s → 1475.440s
Hey, will it bounce back? Wow. Like about half a bit.

[Segment 260] 1475.440s → 1480.040s
This one definitely gets this candle as Action. We, Reaction must be this one.

[Segment 261] 1480.040s → 1485.580s
Wait. Finished this. Here. Do you see? Action Reaction.

[Segment 262] 1485.580s → 1492.220s
Will it go lower than this? Went down first. Can't go down.

[Segment 263] 1493.800s → 1497.960s
In the end this one has more influence. Because this one can't overturn or break through.

[Segment 264] 1497.960s → 1503.000s
It went up like this, that's it, won this High. This old High that's bigger that covered from the start.

[Segment 265] 1504.020s → 1508.660s
BREAK this out. See? This is how we read it.

[Segment 266] 1511.580s → 1519.240s
Should understand more now. Should understand more about the method of reading.

[Segment 267] 1520.000s → 1521.000s
About this. The method of reading is like this. That is.

[Segment 268] 1524.140s → 1528.740s
Read Sideways, read when reversing we already read. This is reading during the way.

[Segment 269] 1528.740s → 1532.940s
Sideways, whether it will continue or Sideways then slap down.

[Segment 270] 1532.940s → 1536.560s
If here it shows signals slap down. If suppose this candle Action Reaction is like this.

[Segment 271] 1537.140s → 1541.760s
Price also has a chance to slap down. But it's not, because it shows that.

[Segment 272] 1542.960s → 1547.460s
It goes the same direction, you see? This says pass. This says don't pass.

[Segment 273] 1547.640s → 1551.260s
Which is this says up, up a lot. This says down little. Correct. It tells correctly.

[Segment 274] 1551.660s → 1555.620s
But if this says up a lot, this says down a lot. Hey, they contradict each other.

[Segment 275] 1555.620s → 1560.080s
See? Clear signals contradict each other. But this one doesn't contradict.

[Segment 276] 1560.080s → 1565.020s
It goes the same direction. This says up. This says down little.

[Segment 277] 1565.020s → 1569.780s
It does come down a little bit, around the sides. And around this level area.

[Segment 278] 1569.780s → 1574.320s
Anyone would have a chance to see it as sell down. Because this is all resistance.

[Segment 279] 1574.320s → 1578.040s
See? Resistance of the trendline. Resistance of the line. Resistance here.

[Segment 280] 1579.660s → 1590.060s
And got a long pinbar coming down closing red like this too.

[Segment 281] 1590.300s → 1595.500s
And Sideways on the side. Slowing down like this.

[Segment 282] 1595.500s → 1602.040s
Momentum going up very little. If looking as Momentum, small small short candles.

[Segment 283] 1602.260s → 1620.040s
Anyone would look sell, slap down. But Action Reaction says it should go up.

[Segment 284] 1620.040s → 1624.580s
It becomes like this. So we understand. About this.

[Segment 285] 1624.580s → 1628.260s
Should be able to apply and use now. Like special episode.

[Segment 286] 1628.560s → 1632.780s
Special image. This special image ends at this episode like this.

[Segment 287] 1632.780s → 1637.660s
Ends at about this much. Which is got more tricks. If calling it tricks.

[Segment 288] 1638.620s → 1642.100s
Additional tricks that you can bring to use in trading next.

[Segment 289] 1642.100s → 1645.460s
Practice. Which is practice then collect experience.

[Segment 290] 1646.440s → 1650.840s
See that normally the candles we see. Candle candle candle candle like this.

[Segment 291] 1651.020s → 1667.640s
There are many things hidden inside. Did you ever notice and look for them and find them?

[Segment 292] 1667.640s → 1670.480s
That's all. Whoever got to the end, congratulations.

[Segment 293] 1670.480s → 1672.720s
Considered that just your learning just this much is, came out, whoever didn't come out.

[Segment 294] 1672.720s → 1675.340s
But learned all 3 ways already. You must go back and review.

[Segment 295] 1675.340s → 1679.000s
It's up to you. You'll get additional weapons here. See?

[Segment 296] 1679.360s → 1681.560s
This. And even more, whoever got to learn young news too.

[Segment 297] 1681.560s → 1683.240s
Congratulations, you almost have everything complete. Others they also see the chart, candles like this.

[Segment 298] 1683.240s → 1687.720s
But they don't see like this. See what's hidden. But you see.

[Segment 299] 1687.980s → 1692.640s
Bring it to apply. Everyone good luck.

[Segment 300] 1693.080s → 1702.500s
[END OF SEGMENT 300]

[Segment 300] 1693.080s → 1702.500s
Move back to the original first. At this one. This one bounced up here. Where did this bounce down? Is there lower? This one is lower.

[Segment 301] 1704.140s → 1709.080s
Then move here. See? Move here. The axis follows like this.

[Segment 302] 1711.580s → 1715.040s
We get Action on this side. Action. As for Reaction, this one is balanced.

[Segment 303] 1715.040s → 1722.280s
This green might not get it yet. Ah, really doesn't get it. Doesn't have. Oh have, have, have.

[Segment 304] 1722.280s → 1726.500s
Have this one. See? This one. It closed like, this thin one. Move a bit.

[Segment 305] 1726.500s → 1739.060s
A bit. Here. But it closed like this. This place it closed. It exceeds this one.

[Segment 306] 1739.980s → 1744.980s
See? In the end it went down. Came down here.

[Segment 307] 1747.440s → 1750.420s
Came down then bounced up. So around this area. And which one is it?

[Segment 308] 1750.420s → 1754.900s
You find which one is lowest. Which looking already it should be.

[Segment 309] 1755.780s → 1762.480s
All very close. Probably the green one.

[Segment 310] 1763.200s → 1768.160s
Take the green one. Here. Action. Reaction. Find it now.

[Segment 311] 1768.420s → 1777.700s
Which one? See. Exceed half or not? If exceed half, count.

[Segment 312] 1777.940s → 1782.220s
Balanced. If exceed half or not? Count.

[Segment 313] 1782.220s → 1786.280s
But it's balanced. You're not sure, then consider the force evenly matched.

[Segment 314] 1786.280s → 1790.440s
Suppose count just these two. Consider very evenly matched.

[Segment 315] 1790.440s → 1791.940s
But if count next one. Let's see. Don't clear this one.

[Segment 316] 1794.420s → 1795.580s
Suppose doesn't exceed half, must count this candle green. This one not clear.

[Segment 317] 1796.000s → 1796.820s
Must count this candle. Evenly matched anyway.

[Segment 318] 1796.820s → 1798.540s
Or here actually exceeds half already. Can't count this candle. Must count this candle. Loses.

[Segment 319] 1798.540s → 1800.860s
Loses. Must do balance again. Wait for them to do balance first.

[Segment 320] 1800.860s → 1801.540s
They go up up. See? When they go up, they still haven't won the old swing.

[Segment 321] 1801.860s → 1802.340s
Uh, old High. Because here the force says isn't enough.

[Segment 322] 1802.340s → 1803.320s
Close to evenly matched. If count here with here, which is evenly matched.

[Segment 323] 1803.320s → 1804.800s
Move up a bit, still doesn't get it. Here if it bounces down.

[Segment 324] 1805.180s → 1806.400s
We'll count this one down. Um, down bounced swing came like this.

[Segment 325] 1806.660s → 1808.140s
Look at Action and Reaction again. But suppose it wins.

[Segment 326] 1808.980s → 1811.160s
Suppose it goes up, it wins. What abnormal will happen?

[Segment 327] 1811.480s → 1814.720s
It will fall down violently anyway. This one doesn't exceed half.

[Segment 328] 1814.720s → 1818.880s
This candle doesn't count. And must count Action this one.

[Segment 329] 1818.880s → 1822.900s
Air Action see already. This one. Loses or not? Loses. Force enough to come down to win this one or not?

[Segment 330] 1823.100s → 1825.880s
Not enough. So it still won't go down. It has no way to be lower than.

[Segment 331] 1825.880s → 1832.320s
Whether opportunity better, not really. Not really. Means no way.

[Segment 332] 1835.100s → 1837.540s
Opportunity for it to be lower than here is small.

[Segment 333] 1838.000s → 1841.540s
Comparing to old Low, Low ahead is small. So shouldn't be lower than this.

[Segment 334] 1842.340s → 1847.440s
So can it bounce down? Bounce down. This must bounce down for sure.

[Segment 335] 1847.440s → 1850.720s
Because here it, it went down. But Reaction it loses. Action.

[Segment 336] 1851.100s → 1856.020s
It might come down to about here. Scroll scroll go. But still no higher.

[Segment 337] 1856.020s → 1859.740s
So it's this swing for sure. Might come down to here.

[Segment 338] 1860.200s → 1862.540s
Go up here. See? It still hasn't come down to win here.

[Segment 339] 1862.540s → 1866.120s
This. Because this one won. This is, uh, this is.

[Segment 340] 1866.120s → 1870.180s
Here see? The balance scale tilts like this. This won. Still wins. Wins.

[Segment 341] 1870.380s → 1875.260s
I mean not reached. See? Not reached. Still not reached.

[Segment 342] 1875.260s → 1878.460s
But asking why it went down. Uh, earlier we didn't look.

[Segment 343] 1878.800s → 1882.060s
It swung to here. And swung up, highest of this one, which one.

[Segment 344] 1883.180s → 1885.400s
Which is this red one. That one then moved like this.

[Segment 345] 1885.400s → 1890.760s
Wow. Got it. This green. This one doesn't get it. This one doesn't get it. This one gets it.

[Segment 346] 1891.060s → 1895.440s
This. This is Action. This is Action already, this one.

[Segment 347] 1895.440s → 1899.700s
This Action. Which is the other Reaction? This doesn't exceed.

[Segment 348] 1900.100s → 1907.040s
It's very balanced, this one. Come draw line right here.

[Segment 349] 1908.620s → 1912.980s
So the green one floats exceeds up. The float floats lower down than here.

[Segment 350] 1912.980s → 1917.200s
Count this one. This one hard. Scroll come this then still doesn't exceed half.

[Segment 351] 1919.440s → 1922.800s
That day count this one. Dark a lot. More a lot.

[Segment 352] 1925.900s → 1933.000s
Then won the old Low which is this Low. Which is this short short Low just this much.

[Segment 353] 1933.000s → 1938.520s
Not this Low. That. Just this Low just that much. Then won, came down.

[Segment 354] 1940.420s → 1943.700s
So this one bounced back up. Swing then changed.

[Segment 355] 1944.720s → 1947.780s
Swing changed like this. Like this. Got it. This lump.

[Segment 356] 1947.780s → 1950.220s
This candle got it. It will be, uh, be like, this one. Have or not?

[Segment 357] 1950.220s → 1953.540s
This still doesn't have at all. Still doesn't have any increase.

[Segment 358] 1954.840s → 1959.000s
We must scroll until find the one that got it. This. Exceed half.

[Segment 359] 1959.960s → 1969.940s
Body exceed half. But it's close, evenly matched.

[Segment 360] 1969.940s → 1974.780s
So should, continue. Still not won this one. Which is, this High like.

[Segment 361] 1974.780s → 1978.180s
No lower than this, we then move to count here.

[Segment 362] 1980.180s → 1987.900s
So it swung up already. And came down here, count here.

[Segment 363] 1987.900s → 1994.140s
Adjust come down. This. Red. This still not half.

[Segment 364] 1994.140s → 1997.600s
This still not half. See. Came over not to half. Can't count this candle.

[Segment 365] 1999.960s → 2004.980s
After this doesn't have. That exceeds half it will have just this one. This.

[Segment 366] 2004.980s → 2017.880s
Which is far. Sometimes we won't count. We'll consider this side doesn't have Reaction already.

[Segment 367] 2018.860s → 2024.460s
Come look green side. This one got it, see? Dark at this, here.

[Segment 368] 2024.460s → 2031.060s
The Action balance scale other side here, but this side doesn't have. Doesn't have Action.

[Segment 369] 2031.460s → 2033.700s
But have Reaction. So price has tendency. From this swing.

[Segment 370] 2033.700s → 2037.220s
That will climb up higher than this High. Higher than this High.

[Segment 371] 2037.220s → 2040.640s
Then going along. Wow. Higher or not? Oops. Dud dud dud. Still not reached.

[Segment 372] 2040.640s → 2043.460s
Go down or not? Still not down. Uh, Sideways continue.

[Segment 373] 2043.960s → 2044.840s
Actually almost count this one already. Uh, wait for confirmation candle.

[Segment 374] 2047.580s → 2048.860s
Then use something to confirm continuously. Oh wait for swing.

[Segment 375] 2050.360s → 2051.480s
Wow. Actually it's, this. Went up and came down.

[Segment 376] 2052.320s → 2054.820s
But it's considered this is all Sideways set. It still doesn't look like clear waves yet.

[Segment 377] 2055.240s → 2057.060s
See? Here. Then go. Go. Ah, went down already. Ah, still not won. See?

[Segment 378] 2057.060s → 2059.580s
This High is still lower. Uh, came down. But this one says have force.

[Segment 379] 2060.160s → 2062.220s
It should go up. Hmm. It bounced down.

[Segment 380] 2063.060s → 2063.980s
But it shouldn't be lower than this already. Because this one has force.

[Segment 381] 2064.640s → 2065.060s
It still doesn't have anything that would say to slap down lower than this.

[Segment 382] 2067.100s → 2067.880s
The set above here already. Uh, wait see if it will bounce or not.

[Segment 383] 2068.360s → 2070.160s
Uh, this. Here. Low is here. Doesn't go lower. This. Still not reached. See?

[Segment 384] 2071.820s → 2072.740s
But this already went up. So I'll change this set to here.

[Segment 385] 2073.240s → 2074.080s
Then here is the balance scale axis. The axis is here.

[Segment 386] 2074.320s → 2076.100s
This one exceeds or not? Exceeds half. Exceeds. Exceeds already. Clear, this exceeds half for sure.

[Segment 387] 2076.720s → 2078.260s
This red one. Green. Exceeds or not? Exceeds half or not?

[Segment 388] 2078.260s → 2079.680s
Exceeds already. You see force exceeds what up. Action Reaction Action High.

[Segment 389] 2079.900s → 2082.460s
The old is here. Latest High. And this one.

[Segment 390] 2083.100s → 2084.540s
But you see the force is different. Compare this set with this set.

[Segment 391] 2087.180s → 2087.660s
Or this set that became swing before. See? This loses, can't go up to exceed this.

[Segment 392] 2087.660s → 2090.260s
This doesn't have force. This one. Here. Count here. Count here.

[Segment 393] 2090.260s → 2092.260s
Green here. Close. Uh, in summary. Less force. Less force and it has a lot of force here.

[Segment 394] 2092.260s → 2094.680s
So what must happen? Less less lot. Remember head and shoulder at all?

[Segment 395] 2094.680s → 2095.860s
Less, so it doesn't pass. Less doesn't pass. Finally third time lot, then broke through up.

[Segment 396] 2097.040s → 2098.120s
So there's tendency that price. Sideways is. If draw frame it will be like, similar to triangle like this.

[Segment 397] 2098.120s → 2099.740s
See? Low raise higher. Higher. Have chance Break triangle up to upper side this side.

[Segment 398] 2100.200s → 2102.960s
Go up after it consolidated for a while. This one we can enter buy.

[Segment 399] 2102.960s → 2104.000s
Then if going let it run long up. It won. High this for sure.

[Segment 400] 2104.000s → 2106.880s
From past already it broke triangle. If this one is triangle really.

[Segment 401] 2107.300s → 2108.320s
We look at Pattern, it must continue at least.

[Segment 402] 2108.320s → 2110.880s
About the distance of about here. At least must have about this distance.

[Segment 403] 2111.560s → 2115.120s
But it only came to here, the lowest point, then it didn't come down to lower zone.

[Segment 404] 2115.120s → 2116.420s
Half of the downward leg. It also has a chance already. In Momentum it also says will raise up.

[Segment 405] 2118.500s → 2125.480s
This reads one way. Um, bring to enhance, this, see? Then I also read Momentum go.

[Segment 406] 2125.680s → 2126.040s
But it's not reading Momentum how. Then I'll see already.

[Segment 407] 2127.640s → 2129.580s
Set this. Set this. Set this. Until at this set.

[Segment 408] 2130.600s → 2133.040s
And the force of this set increased. So there's a chance price will jump up.

[Segment 409] 2133.880s → 2137.140s
Also high at this point already. Um, came to see. Went up. Um, see?

[Segment 410] 2139.560s → 2141.220s
It must win High first. Which it also won successfully already. From this point.

[Segment 411] 2141.380s → 2143.920s
Have force. This is what happened. Do you see the traces of price or not?

[Segment 412] 2144.520s → 2148.360s
That it tells us. Not that it doesn't tell us at all. It tells very clearly.

[Segment 413] 2148.840s → 2152.080s
You just need to find the traces to find them. If you read Momentum.

[Segment 414] 2152.280s → 2156.480s
Some you read Momentum may be from short one candle.

[Segment 415] 2156.660s → 2156.820s
Um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um.

[Segment 416] 2160.300s → 2166.440s
Here here here this is resistance. And broke through the resistance, see?

[Segment 417] 2167.280s → 2170.860s
Anyone would look down. At this time. Um, must come down to line. This. Must come down.

[Segment 418] 2171.240s → 2177.800s
Maybe come to trendline below this? Or come resistance here.

[Segment 419] 2179.780s → 2186.220s
But we read what? Earlier we read what? Action Reaction helps.

[Segment 420] 2186.460s → 2191.420s
Um, the part here it says it must pass. Must go up. Force increased.

[Segment 421] 2191.420s → 2194.700s
Suppose it met this one again. Hey, measure. You measure.

[Segment 422] 2200.080s → 2203.340s
Hey, this one. This is the axis. Here. So you'll get this one.

[Segment 423] 2203.340s → 2205.900s
Here is Action for sure. Exceed half already. This. This Action.

[Segment 424] 2206.320s → 2208.920s
And Reaction. Must be this one. Wait. Finished this. This. See?

[Segment 425] 2208.920s → 2211.440s
Action Reaction. Will it go lower than this? Went down first. Can't go down.

[Segment 426] 2212.040s → 2215.600s
In the end this one has more influence. Because this one can't overturn or break through.

[Segment 427] 2215.600s → 2218.600s
It went up like this, that's it. Won this High. This old High that's bigger that covered from the start.

[Segment 428] 2218.600s → 2233.320s
BREAK this out. See? This is how we read it.

[Segment 429] 2233.320s → 2237.420s
Should understand more now. Should understand more about the method of reading.

[Segment 430] 2237.420s → 2242.480s
About this. The method of reading is like this. That is.

[Segment 431] 2242.480s → 2245.720s
Read Sideways, read when reversing we already read. This is reading during the way.

[Segment 432] 2245.720s → 2263.300s
Sideways, whether it will continue or Sideways then slap down.

[Segment 433] 2263.300s → 2267.160s
If here it shows signals slap down. If suppose this candle Action Reaction is like this.

[Segment 434] 2267.160s → 2271.940s
Price also has a chance to slap down. But it's not, because it shows that.

[Segment 435] 2271.940s → 2276.120s
It goes the same direction, you see? This says pass. This says don't pass.

[Segment 436] 2276.120s → 2281.020s
Which is this says up, up a lot. This says down little. Correct. It tells correctly.

[Segment 437] 2282.400s → 2287.440s
But if this says up a lot, this says down a lot. Hey, they contradict each other.

[Segment 438] 2287.440s → 2290.960s
See? Clear signals contradict each other. But this one doesn't contradict.

[Segment 439] 2290.960s → 2295.460s
It goes the same direction. This says up. This says down little.

[Segment 440] 2296.380s → 2301.280s
It does come down a little bit, around the sides. And around this level area.

[Segment 441] 2301.280s → 2311.000s
Anyone would have a chance to see it as sell down. Because this is all resistance.

[Segment 442] 2311.340s → 2315.480s
See? Resistance of the trendline. Resistance of the line. Resistance here.

[Segment 443] 2315.480s → 2318.000s
And got a long pinbar coming down closing red like this too.

[Segment 444] 2318.000s → 2321.700s
And Sideways on the side. Slowing down like this.

[Segment 445] 2321.700s → 2325.000s
Momentum going up very little. If looking as Momentum, small small short candles.

[Segment 446] 2325.000s → 2340.980s
Anyone would look sell, slap down. But Action Reaction says it should go up.

[Segment 447] 2340.980s → 2367.680s
It becomes like this. So we understand. About this.

[Segment 448] 2367.680s → 2370.400s
Should be able to apply and use now. Like special episode.

[Segment 449] 2371.900s → 2374.100s
Special image. This special image ends at this episode like this.

[Segment 450] 2375.200s → 2378.700s
Ends at about this much. Which is got more tricks. If calling it tricks.

[Segment 451] 2379.900s → 2384.100s
Additional tricks that you can bring to use in trading next.

[Segment 452] 2385.840s → 2389.400s
Practice. Which is practice then collect experience.

[Segment 453] 2389.820s → 2392.940s
See that normally the candles we see. Candle candle candle candle like this.

[Segment 454] 2393.160s → 2395.560s
There are many things hidden inside. Did you ever notice and look for them and find them?

[Segment 455] 2395.560s → 2398.200s
That's all. Whoever got to the end, congratulations.

[Segment 456] 2398.200s → 2402.980s
Considered that just your learning just this much is, came out.

[Segment 457] 2403.200s → 2405.660s
Whoever didn't come out but learned all 3 ways already.

[Segment 458] 2405.660s → 2409.780s
You must go back and review. It's up to you.

[Segment 459] 2412.800s → 2421.000s
You'll get additional weapons here. See? This.

[Segment 460] 2421.560s → 2426.340s
And even more, whoever got to learn Season 2 too.

[Segment 461] 2427.080s → 2431.540s
Congratulations, you almost have everything complete.

[Segment 462] 2432.080s → 2437.560s
Others they also see the chart, candles like this.

[Segment 463] 2438.300s → 2443.260s
But they don't see like this. See what's hidden. But you see.

[Segment 464] 2443.940s → 2449.120s
Bring it to apply. Everyone good luck.

[Segment 465] 2450.360s → 2454.420s
About this. The method of reading is like this. Like read Sideways.

[Segment 466] 2454.920s → 2460.560s
Read when reversing we already read. This is reading during the way, Sideways, whether it will continue or.

[Segment 467] 2460.560s → 2468.420s
Sideways then slap down. If here it shows signals slap down. If suppose this candle Action Reaction is like this.

[Segment 468] 2470.860s → 2478.000s
Price also has a chance to slap down. But it's not, because it shows that it goes the same direction.

[Segment 469] 2479.060s → 2485.900s
This says pass. This says don't pass. Which is this says up, up a lot. This says down little. Correct.

[Segment 470] 2486.340s → 2491.400s
It tells correctly. But if this says up a lot, this says down a lot. Hey, they contradict each other.

[Segment 471] 2491.400s → 2496.360s
See? Clear signals contradict each other. But this one doesn't contradict.

[Segment 472] 2496.760s → 2502.140s
It goes the same direction. This says up. This says down little.

[Segment 473] 2502.840s → 2507.180s
It does come down a little bit, around the sides. And around this level area.

[Segment 474] 2507.180s → 2508.900s
Anyone would have a chance to see it as sell down. Because this is all resistance.

[Segment 475] 2509.580s → 2512.640s
See? Resistance of the trendline. Resistance of the line. Resistance here.

[Segment 476] 2513.760s → 2516.460s
And got a long pinbar coming down closing red like this too.

[Segment 477] 2518.380s → 2522.460s
And Sideways on the side. Slowing down like this.

[Segment 478] 2522.460s → 2526.520s
Momentum going up very little. If looking as Momentum, small small short candles.

[Segment 479] 2528.660s → 2533.440s
Anyone would look sell, slap down. But Action Reaction says it should go up.

[Segment 480] 2533.440s → 2539.420s
It becomes like this. So we understand now. About this.

[Segment 481] 2539.620s → 2547.000s
Should be able to apply and use. Like this special episode.

[Segment 482] 2547.000s → 2551.080s
Special demonstration. This special episode ends here.

[Segment 483] 2551.080s → 2555.420s
Ends about this much. Got more techniques. If calling them techniques.

[Segment 484] 2555.420s → 2560.620s
Additional techniques that you can bring to use in trading next.

[Segment 485] 2560.620s → 2564.660s
Practice. Practice and collect experience.

[Segment 486] 2564.660s → 2568.120s
See that normally the candles we see. Candle candle candle like this.

[Segment 487] 2568.120s → 2585.400s
There are many things hidden inside. Did you ever notice and look for them?

[Segment 488] 2585.400s → 2587.880s
That's all. Whoever watched to the end, congratulations.

[Segment 489] 2587.880s → 2590.360s
Considered that your learning just this much already came out.

[Segment 490] 2590.360s → 2592.980s
Whoever didn't come out but learned all 3 ways already.

[Segment 491] 2594.200s → 2595.620s
You must go back and review. It's up to you.

[Segment 492] 2597.040s → 2600.040s
You'll get additional tools here. See? This.

[Segment 493] 2600.040s → 2613.760s
And even more, whoever learned Season 2 too.

[Segment 494] 2613.760s → 2615.940s
Congratulations, you almost have the complete set.

[Segment 495] 2616.360s → 2617.720s
Others also see the chart, the candles like this.

[Segment 496] 2618.380s → 2620.540s
But they don't see like this. See what's hidden. But you see.

[Segment 497] 2621.080s → 2622.900s
Bring it to apply and use. Everyone good luck.

[Segment 498] 2622.900s → 2624.000s
