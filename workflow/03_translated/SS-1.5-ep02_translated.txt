[Segment 1] 0.000s → 6.240s
Alright, Episode 2! We already know we're comparing this to a balance scale, right? So how many patterns does a balance scale have?

[Segment 2] 6.760s → 29.980s
When I say "patterns," I don't mean what it looks like - I mean the different ways this balance scale can measure forces. What kind of readings can we get?

[Segment 3] 29.980s → 34.940s
Basically, one side starts having more weight than the other.

[Segment 4] 35.720s → 37.380s
And then we get a second scenario like this.

[Segment 5] 37.380s → 38.360s
What's this side?

[Segment 6] 38.840s → 39.800s
Which side is this?

[Segment 7] 40.440s → 45.660s
Action and Reaction - what is this side?

[Segment 8] 45.660s → 50.900s
Action is stronger - the Action force is greater than the Reaction force.

[Segment 9] 51.980s → 54.120s
This one's balanced. Pattern one - already covered.

[Segment 10] 54.800s → 63.840s
Pattern two and pattern three. Pattern three is basically - yeah - Action and Reaction, what's this side?

[Segment 11] 63.840s → 68.460s
Reaction has the stronger force. Now I'm talking about just one direction here.

[Segment 12] 68.460s → 76.260s
Like a downtrend - coming down, down, down, and then you see this pattern - a group of candlesticks forming.

[Segment 13] 76.800s → 82.340s
Like this. And then it goes up like this - reverses. If it was an uptrend...

[Segment 14] 82.340s → 86.800s
Uptrend reversing to downtrend - just flip it to the opposite. But right now...

[Segment 15] 86.800s → 90.700s
Everyone getting this? Doesn't matter what direction - this side that acts first...

[Segment 16] 90.700s → 106.240s
We call it Action. When it bounces back, that's the Reaction.

[Segment 17] 106.240s → 110.800s
So Action on this side - the action comes out. These candlesticks are selling pressure.

[Segment 18] 110.800s → 116.200s
Pushing down, down, down continuously. Then it hits and反s back like this.

[Segment 19] 116.200s → 120.100s
From a Pin Bar pattern like this, the Reaction forms.

[Segment 20] 120.100s → 136.220s
Whether it's big or small, we'll need to examine that. For now, we're learning the theory first.

[Segment 21] 136.220s → 140.200s
We've got Action and Reaction on two sides like this - kind of like this. If I draw it simpler for you...

[Segment 22] 140.200s → 143.820s
It'll look something like this. But is this complete yet?

[Segment 23] 143.820s → 148.260s
Not yet, folks. Let's see what else we need.

[Segment 24] 148.260s → 151.940s
What we're looking for - first thing is, we need to identify Action and Reaction.

[Segment 25] 152.840s → 157.600s
Second, it has to have TWO sides. So this is the candlestick pattern...

[Segment 26] 157.600s → 160.380s
That we're after. Since we need it, we gotta count it, right?

[Segment 27] 160.380s → 163.120s
It needs specific components - one, there has to be a candlestick here.

[Segment 28] 163.120s → 167.100s
The middle candlestick - that's the axis of our balance scale.

[Segment 29] 168.000s → 174.160s
Right? We need the axis - the central pivot point.

[Segment 30] 174.700s → 179.600s
And we need arms on both sides, right? Otherwise we can't measure the forces or weights.

[Segment 31] 180.100s → 184.240s
So we need candlesticks like this. Bottom line - we need at least three candlesticks total.

[Segment 32] 184.240s → 190.340s
But what if it looks like this instead? Does it work? Not yet.

[Segment 33] 191.020s → 194.780s
We still need the axis. Earlier we had an axis like this.

[Segment 34] 195.680s → 198.960s
Dividing two sides. This side we already know - left side from now on is Action.

[Segment 35] 199.480s → 204.660s
Right side is Reaction. And we need candlesticks - we need arms on both sides.

[Segment 36] 204.660s → 208.360s
So we need candlesticks on either side of the center one.

[Segment 37] 210.440s → 215.480s
Two sides - one, two, three. But that's not enough. We just learned that sometimes it flows.

[Segment 38] 216.100s → 218.740s
Hits this pattern and flows - it doesn't form on this side.

[Segment 39] 219.000s → 222.400s
When it flows like that, we're missing the fourth element.

[Segment 40] 223.800s → 228.960s
What's the fourth element? Right here - what needs to happen is in this zone.

[Segment 41] 229.260s → 235.420s
Support and resistance. Yeah, we've got the scale, we've got two arms.

[Segment 42] 236.080s → 240.320s
And it's happening in this area - right in this zone.

[Segment 43] 240.320s → 241.700s
This is what's occurring.

[Segment 44] 242.720s → 248.660s
And we're gonna count - yeah, I could call it "five" if you want.

[Segment 45] 248.660s → 251.200s
These are things to memorize. I'm calling them "things to remember."

[Segment 46] 251.800s → 254.980s
You need to understand them and memorize them. Better than just calling them "rules." So rule five is...

[Segment 47] 255.820s → 259.400s
We're gonna count price on the axis candlestick. Let's talk about the axis first.

[Segment 48] 259.660s → 264.640s
The axis - yeah - no matter what it looks like, whatever the shape...

[Segment 49] 269.360s → 277.480s
The one that's in the middle and occurs at resistance - we count the LOWEST point.

[Segment 50] 283.800s → 289.000s
This is a key rule. Count the lowest point - that means INCLUDING the wick.

[Segment 51] 290.140s → 292.820s
Right now there's no wick showing. Or maybe there is one - doesn't matter.

[Segment 52] 293.060s → 295.160s
If there's a wick like this, we count this as the lowest point.

[Segment 53] 295.620s → 297.700s
This wick here - take the lowest point first.

[Segment 54] 297.700s → 299.360s
You might ask, "Why are we counting this?"

[Segment 55] 299.800s → 302.620s
It's not counting like one, two, three, four, five - I mean, what do we call it?

[Segment 56] 302.620s → 308.760s
It's an important reference point we need to keep track of.

[Segment 57] 308.940s → 310.640s
How we're gonna use it? Let's look.

[Segment 58] 310.940s → 314.700s
We keep this point first. This one here - we include the wick, remember?

[Segment 59] 314.700s → 319.460s
Just for the axis candlestick. Next rule, or next point...

[Segment 60] 319.800s → 325.500s
The next point is about the arms.

[Segment 61] 326.160s → 331.080s
Got it? We have the axis, and we need the arms of the scale.

[Segment 62] 332.640s → 337.040s
For the axis - right here - we count the LOWEST price point of that candlestick.

[Segment 63] 337.040s → 344.200s
That specific one, including the wick. But for the arms - the arms on the Action and Reaction sides...

[Segment 64] 344.760s → 348.600s
We count ONLY the candlestick body. Even if it has a wick...

[Segment 65] 350.040s → 357.480s
Count ONLY the body. Just the body, alright?

[Segment 66] 357.880s → 364.020s
No matter what it looks like, same rule - just the body only.

[Segment 67] 365.840s → 370.700s
Only the body. Even if the wick is this long or whatever.

[Segment 68] 370.700s → 374.660s
Don't count it. Body only - just the body.

[Segment 69] 376.080s → 379.340s
So how many rules do we have now? These are things we need to remember.

[Segment 70] 379.340s → 382.560s
Hold on, there's more. Not done yet.

[Segment 71] 384.560s → 388.540s
We're also gonna use this criterion too - because of this...

[Segment 72] 389.000s → 392.700s
I'm not just teaching Forex here. This can be used in ANY market.

[Segment 73] 393.340s → 399.380s
Whether it's Forex, stocks, gold, oil - whatever.

[Segment 74] 399.380s → 402.740s
So I need to explain it inclusively like this.

[Segment 75] 402.740s → 406.240s
Because sometimes people might get confused, like "The chart would never look like that!"

[Segment 76] 406.580s → 410.440s
Some markets that aren't currency or Forex - it can happen.

[Segment 77] 410.440s → 413.440s
The chart can move however it wants.

[Segment 78] 413.640s → 420.520s
But in Forex, when it opens and closes, it connects perfectly. But other markets might have gaps and all that stuff.

[Segment 79] 421.160s → 428.460s
So the next criterion is - the body of the arms, on both sides. The arms - the bodies...

[Segment 80] 429.740s → 437.060s
Find the 50% mark. 50% - half of that body. Don't count the wick - I already said, don't count wicks.

[Segment 81] 437.060s → 441.660s
Take half. Half - no matter how small or big it is.

[Segment 82] 441.660s → 443.460s
Take half. You might ask, "What do we do with this half?"

[Segment 83] 444.880s → 449.180s
Compare that half to the axis. The axis candlestick.

[Segment 84] 449.180s → 467.040s
How do we compare? Take this one - it's specific to the axis, gotta separate them out.

[Segment 85] 467.040s → 471.680s
Even if the top part is really long, we don't count it. Count this part.

[Segment 86] 471.680s → 476.340s
Count the body separately. And this body extends out to both sides.

[Segment 87] 479.100s → 483.840s
Like an axis like this. And then the arms extend straight out like this.

[Segment 88] 485.000s → 490.220s
All along these arm lines - all the candlesticks along these arm lines...

[Segment 89] 490.500s → 493.180s
That we're counting as arms of the balance scale...

[Segment 90] 494.200s → 497.300s
They must exceed 50%.

[Segment 91] 498.500s → 500.800s
Must be more than half of the body.

[Segment 92] 501.160s → 509.080s
This is what we'll use to consider and analyze things.

[Segment 93] 509.080s → 513.320s
Like for example, this one - it looks like this.

[Segment 94] 515.560s → 518.680s
Where's the halfway point of this one?

[Segment 95] 519.680s → 522.720s
Half is still right here. See how it's lower than this point?

[Segment 96] 522.720s → 527.320s
Lower, yeah. So this candlestick we WON'T consider.

[Segment 97] 528.040s → 532.840s
I'm using the word "consider" here. This one works. This one works.

[Segment 98] 532.840s → 537.860s
But this one? Half is here - lower than this. This one doesn't count.

[Segment 99] 538.580s → 542.580s
Getting it? Can you visualize? Both sides - both arms.

[Segment 100] 543.160s → 548.080s
Action and Reaction - take the ones exceeding half. Count body only, not wicks.

[Segment 101] 548.460s → 552.420s
Body only - we use just that for analysis.

[Segment 102] 552.800s → 555.000s
Let me summarize again in a bit. What do we have so far?

[Segment 103] 557.200s → 563.480s
So Action and Reaction - we'll get a gain roughly like that.

[Segment 104] 564.120s → 569.540s
Okay, let's count them up. How does it work?

[Segment 105] 574.100s → 583.840s
First thing - what do we have? We have the axis, right? One, two, three - we have arms.

[Segment 106] 583.840s → 592.340s
Three things so far. Then we add - support and resistance - that's four. Count the low point, include wick - that's five.

[Segment 107] 593.060s → 593.460s
Five - count the low, include wick - five.

[Segment 108] 594.760s → 604.260s
Yeah, and take the halfway point - that's six. Count body only.

[Segment 109] 604.260s → 610.340s
The arms - the arms of the candlesticks - wait, the arms of the balance scale that are candlesticks - count body only.

[Segment 110] 610.860s → 616.880s
That's seven. Seven now. Now take the price of this - the axis.

[Segment 111] 616.880s → 620.260s
This is the axis. The axis price at the top - not the wick.

[Segment 112] 623.840s → 631.660s
This is the measurement criterion - eight. Eight components you need to remember. Gotta remember or understand them.

[Segment 113] 633.280s → 643.100s
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight - about that many. Put them together, it'll look something like this.

[Segment 114] 643.680s → 652.260s
Combined, we still count only the body. This one doesn't count. This one passes. Because this one doesn't reach half.

[Segment 115] 652.260s → 655.960s
Half stops around here. See? It's lower - doesn't count.

[Segment 116] 655.960s → 663.140s
The ones that don't count mean the power of that candlestick, whether on the Action or Reaction side...

[Segment 117] 663.140s → 668.120s
Remember which side is which? Action, Reaction, Reaction, Reaction.

[Segment 118] 668.120s → 672.120s
It's already absorbed by the axis. It's lower, doesn't stick out.

[Segment 119] 672.760s → 675.420s
Means the axis absorbed it. If this is the selling side, right?

[Segment 120] 675.420s → 679.220s
Price came down more than half like this. The price that came down...

[Segment 121] 679.220s → 696.160s
It's already absorbed inside here. And then it bounces back up.

[Segment 122] 696.160s → 699.000s
The price - it's still absorbed coming out. What do we call it?

[Segment 123] 699.860s → 705.080s
Yeah, it won't all come out. Like this one doesn't count. But if it sticks out...

[Segment 124] 705.400s → 708.080s
Breaks through and comes out already - yeah, like this - it counts.

[Segment 125] 708.080s → 711.740s
Kind of like a magnet field, you know? Count the lowest price point and all that.

[Segment 126] 711.740s → 717.240s
Eight things. Remember them all? Eight things. Alright, now back to this.

[Segment 127] 717.660s → 722.440s
So besides remembering those 8 things, we're gonna go back once more to this diagram.

[Segment 128] 722.440s → 724.620s
There are 3 patterns. See it yet?

[Segment 129] 726.200s → 729.340s
Wait, wait - let me erase first.

[Segment 130] 735.560s → 740.580s
Like this - what I'm about to explain.

[Segment 131] 741.140s → 748.360s
Like this. If we see this pattern, it means price is running down and up.

[Segment 132] 748.360s → 751.480s
Going up, right? So yeah, it goes up.

[Segment 133] 753.000s → 756.540s
But it won't go up strongly. I'm saying "not going up strongly."

[Segment 134] 756.540s → 764.820s
That means the Action side has more force than the Reaction side.

[Segment 135] 766.260s → 767.960s
You ask, "More like this?" Well, it doesn't exceed it.

[Segment 136] 767.960s → 770.440s
It can't overcome it.

[Segment 137] 772.880s → 776.320s
This side is selling pressure - pushing down continuously.

[Segment 138] 776.820s → 779.320s
Hits this point and goes up - the price goes up as Reaction.

[Segment 139] 779.320s → 782.920s
But the next one that should confirm the force of the center axis...

[Segment 140] 782.920s → 785.840s
Turns back, can't beat this side.

[Segment 141] 785.840s → 788.220s
That means the force is weaker.

[Segment 142] 788.220s → 791.080s
So this Reaction side loses.

[Segment 143] 791.860s → 796.180s
When it loses, it doesn't have enough force to go far up.

[Segment 144] 797.480s → 803.400s
So it'll only go up a little. As for this one - it's relatively...

[Segment 145] 803.400s → 807.680s
Balanced - goes up too. Honestly, we can say it goes up stronger.

[Segment 146] 807.680s → 811.760s
Than this one. And this one definitely goes up the strongest.

[Segment 147] 812.660s → 818.180s
More than this and more than this. Because the Reaction side WINS.

[Segment 148] 819.460s → 828.260s
Yeah, Action hits support/resistance - bounces back up higher than before.

[Segment 149] 828.540s → 832.340s
Wins like this. There might be other candlesticks here - we don't care.

[Segment 150] 832.340s → 836.440s
We just want the candlesticks in the set we need, that's all.

[Segment 151] 836.440s → 840.900s
We want the balance scale to measure the power. Got it?

[Segment 152] 840.900s → 844.500s
If we use this, ultimately it becomes these 3 patterns.

[Segment 153] 845.240s → 847.860s
Weak force - this is weak force.

[Segment 154] 849.820s → 855.080s
Evenly matched - balanced - relatively evenly matched. And finally wins - force is much stronger.

[Segment 155] 855.080s → 856.980s
Reaction side - force is much stronger.

[Segment 156] 858.380s → 862.760s
Simple balance scale - there are only 3 patterns. That's it - equal.

[Segment 157] 866.520s → 868.220s
Action side is stronger.

[Segment 158] 871.320s → 878.400s
Reaction side force is much stronger, heavier. That's all there is - nothing more than this.

[Segment 159] 879.220s → 883.040s
Now you ask, "How do we start using this?" Once we know this, how do we apply it, right?

[Segment 160] 884.620s → 885.620s
Let's look at that.

[Segment 161] 892.080s → 893.900s
When using it - use it like this.

[Segment 162] 897.080s → 902.980s
Say we look at this diagram. This one, alright? We're trading and we see price running like this.

[Segment 163] 905.240s → 910.580s
Action, got it? Action, Reaction going up.

[Segment 164] 919.460s → 923.240s
We're gonna buy. If you learned Momentum from Season 1...

[Segment 165] 923.240s → 923.660s
You would...

[Segment 166] 923.980s → 928.640s
Some people already got to buy inside the candlestick wick - got a good price.

[Segment 167] 928.640s → 935.200s
But this one here - this section is what we call the SAFEST entry point.

[Segment 168] 935.200s → 939.040s
You might have to wait. Instead of getting in right here, you might have to wait - wait for this candlestick.

[Segment 169] 939.420s → 942.900s
We wait for all 3 to complete first - there's the center axis, there's the arm, there's the arm.

[Segment 170] 943.640s → 947.520s
When it confirms it's gonna continue - wait, not continue - it's gonna reverse like this.

[Segment 171] 947.520s → 952.680s
We can enter on the next one. Enter on the fourth candlestick, and we open...

[Segment 172] 952.680s → 956.700s
The price to continue. But it's kind of... see?

[Segment 173] 956.700s → 960.480s
When it confirms, it won't - it won't - yeah, it won't.

[Segment 174] 962.440s → 969.260s
So when we enter, let it run until it hits support/resistance and sees another set on the opposite side.

[Segment 175] 969.260s → 977.420s
Like Action-Reaction again. That's it. Place Stop Loss below the low price here. This is how we use it.

[Segment 176] 979.020s → 984.520s
I'll explain the theory first - then we'll go into real charts and you'll understand better.

[Segment 177] 990.480s → 996.700s
Or if there's a lot here - same amount or more than here - it gets broken and fails - price might not continue.

[Segment 178] 996.700s → 1006.320s
It becomes a reversal period coming down like this too. Because remember, when price runs, it has to run like this - remember?

[Segment 179] 1006.320s → 1015.000s
And this - there'll be sideways when patterns haven't formed yet. Can't tell at all if this is sideways or not.

[Segment 180] 1015.460s → 1023.620s
Why? It could become a reversal point like this already. But if it's sideways, it continues to this one.

[Segment 181] 1024.360s → 1030.120s
Then hits the real peak, and changes direction to downtrend - continues down.

[Segment 182] 1030.420s → 1033.760s
The chart talks like this. And here - it comes to this new side.

[Segment 183] 1033.760s → 1039.600s
It's measuring the cycle of this, cycling on and on, cycling continuously.

[Segment 184] 1039.600s → 1042.940s
So look at this point - it's the same thing.

[Segment 185] 1042.940s → 1060.100s
Yeah, this spot doesn't have enough force. It becomes sideways right here.

[Segment 186] 1061.000s → 1063.200s
Now we're getting into practical application.

[Segment 187] 1064.040s → 1067.500s
Let's check out the next episode. We'll get into practical use - how to actually apply it.

[Segment 188] 1068.360s → 1072.920s
We've covered all the theory now. Next step is practical application.
