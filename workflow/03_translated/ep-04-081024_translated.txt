[1] 1.30s - 11.62s
Hello everyone, we've reached Part 3, the component that works together with the first two parts we've already learned.

[2] 11.90s - 17.02s
That is, candlesticks and support and resistance, and this is the final component.

[3] 17.02s - 23.10s
Before we move to the final part that we'll learn next, which brings everything together.

[4] 23.86s - 27.54s
To create a clear picture when you look at charts, read charts, and read them more clearly.

[5] 27.78s - 29.66s
It's called Dow Theory.

[6] 32.72s - 35.34s
So this guy Dow established it.

[7] 35.34s - 37.36s
The market has its own cycles.

[8] 37.36s - 44.04s
There's greed and fear, all these things exist in the up and down cycles of the chart.

[9] 44.38s - 46.44s
That's it, according to Dow's first principle.

[10] 47.04s - 49.06s
The market has already absorbed everything.

[11] 50.06s - 50.90s
Second principle.

[12] 50.90s - 53.32s
Dow says the market moves in trends.

[13] 53.56s - 54.10s
Always.

[14] 54.78s - 56.06s
Is it always true?

[15] 56.06s - 57.04s
There will be some periods.

[16] 58.28s - 60.08s
Where it consolidates.

[17] 60.08s - 63.00s
So we'll have these.

[18] 64.02s - 64.98s
Uptrend.

[19] 65.28s - 66.20s
Moving up.

[20] 66.78s - 68.42s
Price continues moving up.

[21] 68.42s - 70.34s
Continuously.

[22] 72.12s - 73.00s
Downtrend.

[23] 73.20s - 74.18s
Downward trend.

[24] 74.18s - 80.16s
This is uptrend, downtrend, price will keep going up or down continuously.

[25] 81.86s - 84.00s
These have their limitations.

[26] 84.46s - 87.18s
Uptrend - Higher High and Higher Low.

[27] 88.60s - 90.18s
Downtrend is lower high.

[28] 90.84s - 92.04s
Followed by lower low.

[29] 92.04s - 94.06s
I'll expand on this later.

[30] 94.06s - 97.56s
And this one is called no trend, or it's moving sideways.

[31] 97.56s - 101.44s
It's not going up and it's not going down, moving sideways, we call it sideways.

[32] 113.56s - 128.62s
Like this, it's called downtrend, uptrend, which consists of swing high, swing low, swing high, swing low.

[33] 129.06s - 134.06s
At this point, you should all understand swing high and swing low now, it's just price going up and down, up and down like this.

[34] 134.96s - 140.38s
When it goes up and comes down, when it turns downward, we call it swing high. When it turns upward, that's swing low.

[35] 141.16s - 145.02s
Whether it's an uptrend or downtrend, where it turns upward is always a swing low.

[36] 145.80s - 147.72s
Where it turns downward is always a swing high.

[37] 147.72s - 153.40s
When we learned about support and resistance, these are the points where we draw support and resistance levels.

[38] 154.00s - 157.70s
At the swing high and swing low points, same thing.

[39] 158.78s - 163.18s
This picture is the same, but right now we're not learning about support and resistance.

[40] 164.00s - 167.54s
We're learning about trends.

[41] 168.60s - 170.78s
The definition of a trend.

[42] 172.34s - 181.18s
The purple part here, for price to be in a trend, it must have these components.

[43] 184.32s - 186.38s
You need to have these 4 points.

[44] 186.70s - 195.22s
First, if it's an uptrend, you need to have the initial high, the original high.

[45] 197.04s - 210.52s
Let me change this a bit, oh well, never mind. And you need to have the original low, see?

[46] 210.78s - 218.72s
High and low, you need these two parts first. And the parts that tell us it's an uptrend are these two.

[47] 220.34s - 227.96s
Higher high. Higher high, translating from English, if we translate to Thai, high means the height, the original high point.

[48] 229.44s - 235.82s
Higher high means a high point that's higher than the original, this point here is called higher high.

[49] 236.36s - 240.30s
Is it higher? If we draw a line, it's higher, it went up further, see?

[50] 240.48s - 241.54s
This is called higher high.

[51] 242.12s - 246.28s
And another component you need to have to call it an uptrend.

[52] 246.28s - 249.40s
That is, you need to have a higher low.

[53] 250.60s - 253.58s
Which is a low that's higher than the original low.

[54] 255.34s - 257.10s
Same thing, look, drawing a line.

[55] 257.80s - 260.42s
This low is higher than this one, it doesn't touch here.

[56] 267.96s - 273.50s
Just having these two, high and low, is not enough. You need higher high and higher low.

[57] 274.00s - 287.84s
In Thai, we say you have a new highest point and a low point that's elevated.

[58] 289.60s - 299.84s
Low, but not as low as before, it's elevated. High, even higher than before. With one, two, three, four, these 4 components, it's called an uptrend.

[59] 301.50s - 311.20s
Downtrend is the same, you need 4 components. You need a starting point, which is the original low.

[60] 314.10s - 316.72s
Meaning you have the initial low and the initial high.

[61] 317.84s - 322.70s
And when it swings down, we get a lower low.

[62] 322.94s - 324.76s
Which is a low that's lower than the original low.

[63] 326.24s - 327.38s
This is the original low here.

[64] 328.98s - 332.32s
This one breaks through this line, see how it's lower?

[65] 332.32s - 335.40s
So it's called lower than the original low, a lower low.

[66] 335.84s - 340.34s
And the high, of course, must be a lower high.

[67] 340.94s - 343.86s
A high that's lower than the original high.

[68] 345.30s - 346.06s
The original high is here.

[69] 348.68s - 351.16s
The new high doesn't reach it, see? Lower than the original.

[70] 352.08s - 354.64s
This is called Dow Trends, a downtrend.

[71] 355.88s - 360.42s
You need these same 4 components, but if you only have one of them.

[72] 361.84s - 366.40s
You have the original high, let's say, and you have the low.

[73] 368.90s - 373.90s
But you don't have a higher high, you don't have this one.

[74] 374.24s - 378.06s
It's still just a high, like this.

[75] 386.18s - 392.44s
And you still have a high, and it's a low.

[76] 395.46s - 402.58s
It's a low, it doesn't have those two words yet, these two.

[77] 402.58s - 403.88s
Higher higher, lower lower.

[78] 405.00s - 407.82s
It's high high high low low.

[79] 408.50s - 413.62s
So it's not a trend, easy right?

[80] 414.02s - 417.42s
But if during this period, it stays here.

[81] 420.82s - 423.68s
It goes up like this, and whoosh, comes down.

[82] 424.26s - 428.58s
What happens? The original low.

[83] 428.98s - 432.80s
This one stays the same, it's still a low, see?

[84] 432.80s - 435.16s
But here it went higher.

[85] 435.66s - 436.92s
So what will happen here?

[86] 438.48s - 440.00s
Here we'll get a higher high.

[87] 441.94s - 443.46s
This is a higher high now.

[88] 446.06s - 447.82s
This, oh, can't see it at all.

[89] 449.52s - 450.32s
Let me remove it.

[90] 452.42s - 453.68s
How do I remove this?

[91] 460.34s - 461.56s
Should be like this, let's see.

[92] 474.82s - 479.72s
Let's look at this again carefully.

[93] 483.24s - 490.68s
We see this now, original high, original low, one, two, and suddenly it goes up, we encounter a new one.

[94] 492.62s - 493.32s
Encounter a new one.

[95] 494.50s - 496.42s
I can change the text, like this.

[96] 497.58s - 498.04s
Sure.

[97] 500.98s - 502.14s
Higher high.

[98] 502.60s - 505.42s
After it swings up, it doesn't go further, it comes down.

[99] 505.42s - 508.52s
It retraces down, and after retracing, coincidentally.

[100] 509.86s - 511.00s
Coincidentally again.

[101] 511.66s - 513.72s
It turns back up a bit.

[102] 513.94s - 516.74s
Just a little bit is enough, doesn't need much, and it becomes.

[103] 519.32s - 519.98s
Higher low.

[104] 523.30s - 525.18s
See how it came down but didn't reach this low?

[105] 525.18s - 528.96s
So it has to be an elevated low, right? Now the components come together.

[106] 528.96s - 531.22s
If we have these 4, one, two, three, four.

[107] 532.28s - 536.90s
Just these are enough, don't need more. With just these we can call it an uptrend.

[108] 537.48s - 541.20s
It's an uptrend, meaning it broke out from.

[109] 544.98s - 546.72s
Broke out from the sideways range and.

[110] 547.14s - 559.10s
It's an uptrend that we're ready to trade as an uptrend now. Let's look at a chart for a bit, just a bit, like this.

[111] 560.92s - 576.12s
Like this, what kind of trend is this? Downtrend, clearly, because, this part is easy, clearly a downtrend, why?

[112] 576.12s - 585.10s
Uh, why? Well, here, the original high.

[113] 597.18s - 599.24s
Oh, Dow Theory is here.

[114] 616.34s - 622.34s
Let me redo this, hard to write, let me do it like this and capture it.

[115] 625.44s - 626.52s
How much?

[116] 628.68s - 629.00s
High.

[117] 629.78s - 634.18s
High, I'll start counting from here, or you can count from here, whichever you prefer.

[118] 634.70s - 642.52s
High, initial high, initial high, and then low.

[119] 643.46s - 647.70s
And what happens here? Lower high.

[120] 647.70s - 653.34s
High. And what about here? Lower.

[121] 657.22s - 658.40s
Low, a low that's lower than the original low.

[122] 658.40s - 662.78s
Is it really lower? The high is here, the original high is here.

[123] 664.62s - 668.74s
A high that's lower than the original high, it's clearly lower because this one doesn't touch this line, see?

[124] 669.36s - 673.68s
What about the low? A low that's lower than the original low.

[125] 674.14s - 677.42s
This one here, the original low is at this line, this is lower than this line.

[126] 678.12s - 680.02s
That reaches the swing low.

[127] 681.82s - 682.62s
Therefore.

[128] 683.20s - 685.70s
Of course this is a downtrend.

[129] 685.70s - 687.36s
We can call it a downtrend.

[130] 688.68s - 691.98s
See? And it will continue in its series.

[131] 691.98s - 694.28s
Until it changes on its own.

[132] 694.78s - 695.68s
Right.

[133] 696.28s - 698.06s
The opposite for an uptrend.

[134] 699.80s - 701.90s
This one is clearly a downtrend.

[135] 703.88s - 705.22s
It repeats itself.

[136] 705.22s - 706.38s
Accordingly.

[137] 706.38s - 726.96s
Like this, ah, like this, this, this, yeah, this, yeah, still.

[138] 726.96s - 730.46s
Yes, when it completes the components continuously, this is called.

[139] 730.46s - 734.46s
A downtrend, quite clearly, uptrend.

[140] 736.38s - 741.58s
And what about uptrend? Uptrend is.

[141] 745.96s - 751.96s
Which area should we use? This area works, easy.

[142] 759.54s - 764.84s
This one, we can count from here too.

[143] 767.34s - 769.34s
Draw it in, like this.

[144] 773.54s - 777.78s
As the starting point, we'll make it a low.

[145] 779.72s - 781.02s
Let's say counting the swing.

[146] 781.02s - 781.94s
Let's say counting the swing.

[147] 781.96s - 784.08s
Count the big one, this one, or count the small ones.

[148] 784.08s - 785.72s
Let's say we count from here.

[149] 785.94s - 788.22s
It's a high.

[150] 790.22s - 792.40s
And then it retraces down, see this here?

[151] 792.40s - 793.36s
Price retraces down.

[152] 799.24s - 800.16s
It's a higher low.

[153] 802.42s - 804.40s
Is it a higher low? Yes.

[154] 804.40s - 806.40s
Because the original low is here.

[155] 806.94s - 808.20s
But price stopped here.

[156] 808.68s - 810.18s
It didn't come down to touch this line.

[157] 810.18s - 811.94s
Meaning it's a low that's higher than before.

[158] 812.40s - 816.50s
Of course you can see it with your eyes, I'm just citing the theory.

[159] 817.72s - 821.42s
Therefore, this point must be a higher high.

[160] 822.54s - 827.08s
There, and then it will.

[161] 827.88s - 831.00s
Just like before, continuing like this.

[162] 832.66s - 836.28s
Better find this one, here, here.

[163] 836.28s - 836.30s
Here.

[164] 839.90s - 840.68s
Higher low.

[165] 842.70s - 843.56s
Elevated low.

[166] 844.64s - 845.44s
Elevated low.

[167] 846.40s - 851.22s
Elevated low, and this one.

[168] 851.46s - 852.88s
This one is about the same.

[169] 853.68s - 855.96s
Let's just stop here.

[170] 857.00s - 859.82s
Actually I think it's still elevated if you look closely at this point.

[171] 862.20s - 862.86s
A tiny bit.

[172] 865.08s - 866.26s
If you don't want to be confused, it's very close.

[173] 868.04s - 873.18s
But just this much, you can see it's an uptrend.

[174] 875.06s - 879.56s
Uptrend according to Dow's definition is like this.

[175] 880.34s - 888.72s
You have 2 starting points, a low and a high, and if you have higher high and higher low, it's called an uptrend.

[176] 890.56s - 897.28s
The earlier one was a downtrend, and there's another type where it doesn't go up and doesn't go down.

[177] 903.70s - 907.72s
We can use this one, right here.

[178] 920.22s - 922.24s
Make it smaller, this one.

[179] 931.42s - 932.48s
Just draw the lines.

[180] 934.34s - 939.46s
It's a range, see? Moving within a range.

[181] 942.80s - 944.92s
And for the starting point, it will be.

[182] 948.72s - 949.48s
Can find it here.

[183] 950.94s - 955.74s
Start here, this point.

[184] 959.08s - 959.40s
Low.

[185] 961.50s - 964.56s
There will always be 2 points.

[186] 965.62s - 966.82s
We need to find the starting point first.

[187] 967.28s - 967.44s
High.

[188] 969.32s - 971.10s
Low, there's a low here, low.

[189] 974.68s - 976.40s
Low and then swing up to a high.

[190] 980.52s - 982.64s
This has a higher high.

[191] 984.96s - 987.38s
Looks like it could be uptrend, has a higher high.

[192] 987.86s - 993.70s
But that's okay, let's count from here first.

[193] 999.82s - 1000.28s
Ah.

[194] 1000.28s - 1000.54s
Ah.

[195] 1000.54s - 1001.08s
Ah.

[196] 1001.08s - 1001.08s


[197] 1001.08s - 1001.08s


[198] 1001.08s - 1001.08s


[199] 1001.10s - 1002.46s
Looking at it, it seems like it could be.

[200] 1003.12s - 1003.54s
Actually.

[201] 1003.54s - 1006.04s
According to theory, it would be right.

[202] 1008.52s - 1009.64s
But it might not be.

[203] 1009.64s - 1010.38s
Because this.

[204] 1010.38s - 1011.42s
We're counting this swing first.

[205] 1011.42s - 1014.04s
We're counting this high as the starting point because then there must be a low here too.

[206] 1015.06s - 1016.98s
This one will be a higher low.

[207] 1019.12s - 1019.76s
Right here.

[208] 1021.76s - 1023.58s
One, two, three, four, all 4.

[209] 1023.58s - 1023.94s
Okay.

[210] 1023.94s - 1025.10s
This is an uptrend.

[211] 1026.14s - 1027.20s
Just this part.

[212] 1031.10s - 1038.40s
They're about equal, it seems like it's not going to elevate, so exclude that, and then when it comes up here.

[213] 1039.90s - 1042.82s
It becomes a lower high.

[214] 1045.70s - 1047.14s
And then it comes down again.

[215] 1049.86s - 1054.46s
This is lower than this, it's a lower low.

[216] 1059.88s - 1065.80s
Simply put, it's no longer continuing in an upward series.

[217] 1067.28s - 1070.92s
Low, high, and then it should go up again.

[218] 1071.26s - 1074.08s
It breaks down right here, no continuation.

[219] 1075.32s - 1077.34s
Here it goes down, just looking at this, it's down.

[220] 1078.90s - 1084.44s
It goes up, but this high here is almost equal.

[221] 1084.44s - 1084.44s


[222] 1084.70s - 1089.74s
It's still not clearly counted as one, okay, this one might come down to be.

[223] 1089.74s - 1095.20s
There is that, but it goes back up, look, evenly matched again, down then up.

[224] 1095.74s - 1100.86s
Very simply, if you look, look, just look at this period, I'll use the pen right away.

[225] 1100.86s - 1105.54s
This period, going up, see? Up, oh.

[226] 1108.82s - 1109.72s
But this period is down.

[227] 1112.66s - 1119.50s
If you just look at this, oh, this part is up again, if you look clearly, it's about.

[228] 1119.50s - 1131.20s
Like support and resistance, remember? It's a zone, it's a zone, it's in.

[229] 1131.20s - 1138.52s
A range, it will be rectangular, I mean, it's like, approximately like.

[230] 1138.52s - 1144.80s
A range, and price is moving inside, no matter what, it seems to be.

[231] 1144.80s - 1148.22s
Bouncing inside a bit, but in the end, it's just moving.

[232] 1148.22s - 1156.02s
Not going anywhere, moving sideways, if it's moving like this.

[233] 1158.68s - 1160.98s
You'll see it looks like waves of equal height, like this.

[234] 1164.98s - 1175.76s
You can see it's clearly sideways. If you want to be sure, look at it with support and resistance, it looks pretty messy.

[235] 1175.76s - 1185.46s
Breaking everything, support and resistance lines, breaking through all over the place, breaking like crazy, and not really respecting support and resistance that much.

[236] 1186.40s - 1191.92s
Like this is support, if it comes down and becomes resistance, no it's not.

[237] 1191.92s - 1194.18s
It breaks back and forth, this is called sideways.

[238] 1195.80s - 1199.26s
No trend, not trending, understand?

[239] 1199.94s - 1204.22s
Let's keep it simple for now, don't think too much, don't think too much, don't overcomplicate it.

[240] 1204.22s - 1215.44s
This is a trend. I'm explaining this for beginners.

[241] 1216.62s - 1220.80s
Coming back to our topic, you should be able to see which is which now.

[242] 1221.76s - 1228.84s
Okay, drawing trend lines, we talked about this in the support and resistance lesson.

[243] 1229.22s - 1235.58s
This is the correct way to draw it, he shows examples, this one cuts through, this one is wrong, skip it.

[244] 1236.56s - 1244.52s
Okay, now let's look at trend analysis, when it's an uptrend or downtrend, or sideways.

[245] 1244.52s - 1253.16s
What happens is the chart that forms will be a trend that looks like waves, you understand it's like waves?

[246] 1255.54s - 1257.94s
Yeah, we have waves, like waves.

[247] 1257.94s - 1261.90s
Look, let me clear the purple first.

[248] 1269.94s - 1278.36s
Like this, look, it moves like this, we call it waves.

[249] 1280.14s - 1283.92s
When we first talked, we learned specifically about individual candles.

[250] 1283.92s - 1292.34s
Candlesticks, individual candles like this, but many candlesticks combined continuously.

[251] 1292.70s - 1298.24s
They form wave patterns, right? In these waves, there will be how many candlesticks?

[252] 1298.24s - 1304.62s
Tons of them, countless, who knows, like this, but we won't focus on that anymore.

[253] 1304.62s - 1307.02s
At this point, we only focus on the waves.

[254] 1310.12s - 1312.44s
We're looking at the big picture.

[255] 1315.08s - 1317.56s
Now these waves are what we'll analyze.

[256] 1318.32s - 1324.34s
At first when we learned in the first part about candlesticks, we analyzed.

[257] 1324.76s - 1326.04s
We analyzed the candlesticks themselves.

[258] 1327.36s - 1332.52s
We read them candle by candle, continuously, to see what events might happen.

[259] 1332.52s - 1346.86s
Going forward into the future, whether it'll keep going up or if there's a tendency to go down by reading candle by candle. Now we'll read them as waves, the big picture, to see.

[260] 1348.24s - 1354.46s
What's likely ahead, I use the word likely, what it could be like.

[261] 1358.48s - 1359.26s
Let's continue.

[262] 1362.74s - 1367.98s
We need to pair them up, pair them up, when we see the overall chart like this, showing like this.

[263] 1369.50s - 1372.30s
We pair swing high with swing low.

[264] 1374.26s - 1380.22s
In sets, one after another like this, like this, going up, this is low, this is high, and running back to low.

[265] 1380.22s - 1384.28s
Three points, ABC, or one, two, three, easy to count, like.

[266] 1384.28s - 1390.44s
This, you see it? This, wait, let me show you again.

[267] 1390.44s - 1391.46s
One, like this.

[268] 1396.20s - 1404.78s
This, one, two, three, this is one period, when it's done, we count.

[269] 1404.78s - 1413.34s
A new set, from 3 here, it becomes 1, 2, 3 of this set, of this set.

[270] 1414.70s - 1423.94s
Count again, here it becomes 1, 2, 3 of this set, and then count a new set.

[271] 1424.40s - 1429.16s
And if there's more, keep counting continuously as 1-2-3, 1-2-3, pairing them up like this.

[272] 1432.18s - 1438.32s
You ask, for what purpose? To analyze the waves, analyze the strength of the waves.

[273] 1438.32s - 1444.12s
Whether the trend is strong or weak, ah, how it's moving.

[274] 1444.12s - 1448.84s
Which direction it will go, after we've already analyzed candlesticks, we'll look at waves as well.

[275] 1449.56s - 1454.04s
It's another tool, or another piece of knowledge, if we know and combine everything.

[276] 1455.10s - 1457.72s
It will help us read charts even better.

[277] 1457.72s - 1460.52s
Sometimes when we read candlesticks, they might say one thing, but waves say another.

[278] 1460.52s - 1461.50s
Whoa, which one do we believe?

[279] 1462.04s - 1467.92s
This, we'll get to this in the final part that we'll learn together.

[280] 1468.26s - 1474.18s
This part, let's just take it step by step first, pairing like this.

[281] 1474.18s - 1489.60s
It will have its own names, like M, like this.

[282] 1489.60s - 1491.06s
Anyway, pairing them up.

[283] 1494.32s - 1500.72s
They will classify them once paired, see how they're paired? But they'll categorize a bit.

[284] 1501.90s - 1507.60s
Type A, Type A is when it goes up and then retraces.

[285] 1507.60s - 1514.80s
Goes up then retraces, see? Goes up then retraces, when they classify types, they look at the retracement.

[286] 1514.80s - 1516.94s
Not when it goes up, but when it retraces.

[287] 1517.90s - 1521.50s
Vice versa when it goes down then turns back up.

[288] 1521.50s - 1523.56s
We count at the point where it turns up.

[289] 1524.86s - 1525.34s
Confused?

[290] 1526.80s - 1527.74s
Count here.

[291] 1528.48s - 1530.40s
The theory counts here, the theory counts.

[292] 1530.40s - 1531.94s
If it's upward movement, count when it retraces.

[293] 1533.08s - 1534.22s
But if it's downward movement.

[294] 1535.28s - 1536.94s
Count when it turns back up.

[295] 1537.54s - 1538.06s
Right here.

[296] 1538.94s - 1543.90s
Right here, to classify or categorize the type of wave.

[297] 1545.54s - 1552.98s
Type A, Type A is when it retraces, and counting the full length of the rise, it comes down less than 50%.

[298] 1554.74s - 1560.24s
If it's a down move, it retraces back up less than 50% of what it came down.

[299] 1561.74s - 1568.52s
This is type 1, Type A, like this, goes up then down, if the level is here, it doesn't reach it, and continues.

[300] 1570.70s - 1578.60s
Type B reaches about 50%, approximately, retracing approximately.

[301] 1578.60s - 1582.08s
And the last type, this is an example, retraces about 50%.

[302] 1582.36s - 1587.28s
Type C retraces more than 50% of the initial rise that went up.

[303] 1587.56s - 1592.62s
The impulse move, the retracement comes down and bounces back more than 50%.

[304] 1593.30s - 1594.42s
Like this, like this.

[305] 1595.98s - 1600.18s
You ask why do we need to know? Because each pattern A-B-C.

[306] 1600.18s - 1603.18s
It indicates the strength of the move.

[307] 1604.52s - 1607.36s
Look, they have their rules, rules of thumb.

[308] 1608.66s - 1626.68s
Pullback wave, this is it, pullback wave is the move that goes against the original direction. Simply put, if in this case it's an uptrend, it goes up, goes up meaning it has low, higher low, higher low, higher high, higher high, higher high.

[309] 1627.42s - 1636.44s
But when it retraces before it makes a higher high in the uptrend, it's divided into these 3 types, less than 50%, at 50%, more than 50%.

[310] 1637.16s - 1647.34s
The one that reaches or doesn't reach, exceeds or doesn't, the stronger the retracement is, the weaker the uptrend becomes.

[311] 1648.12s - 1655.70s
Meaning like this, goes up like this, reaches 50%, this one doesn't reach 50%.

[312] 1655.98s - 1662.56s
But this one exceeds 50%, the wave will be weak, meaning when it continues, it won't go very far.

[313] 1668.22s - 1675.78s
If it goes far, it has a chance, like this, you can look at this wave, look at this one, went up this much, let's say 50% is here.

[314] 1676.36s - 1678.54s
It only retraced this much and continues.

[315] 1679.10s - 1680.56s
See? It continues much further.

[316] 1682.30s - 1683.16s
But look at this one.

[317] 1683.80s - 1685.94s
Went up and retraced more than 50%.

[318] 1686.68s - 1688.68s
Went and struggled like this.

[319] 1688.68s - 1692.40s
If we look in terms of candlestick strength.

[320] 1692.40s - 1693.42s
It seems like it's starting to.

[321] 1694.46s - 1696.52s
Soon it will start, maybe around this area.

[322] 1696.52s - 1698.24s
And it will probably curve down.

[323] 1702.32s - 1703.72s
Now let's look at quality.

[324] 1703.72s - 1708.62s
The quality of the trend.

[325] 1709.74s - 1715.86s
Like this one, we'll look specifically at the moves that go in the direction of the trend.

[326] 1716.86s - 1719.26s
In the direction of the trend, which is.

[327] 1730.02s - 1732.26s
Let's say uptrend.

[328] 1735.14s - 1739.84s
Another one is downtrend, the earlier example was downtrend, right?

[329] 1740.42s - 1742.52s
Look at the moves that go in the same direction as the trend.

[330] 1742.52s - 1745.18s
This trend goes up, this trend goes down.

[331] 1747.26s - 1747.92s
We look at this one.

[332] 1748.62s - 1748.90s
Oh.

[333] 1749.40s - 1757.62s
For example, look at this one, look at this one, look at this, look at this, it's downtrend, we look at where it goes down.

[334] 1757.62s - 1760.74s
We don't look at where it goes up, we look at where it goes down, see?

[335] 1762.78s - 1767.08s
Look at the distance, measure the distance, bop, bop, the consistency, see?

[336] 1767.50s - 1774.06s
About 250, it's between this, this, like this is considered a strong trend.

[337] 1774.06s - 1782.34s
It's a good trend, it's a quality trend, because it will just keep going like this, see? When it comes down.

[338] 1782.34s - 1804.04s
This trend, downtrend, it will keep going continuously, won't stop. If we buy here.

[339] 1804.04s - 1807.50s
Fifty, quite inconsistent, like the earlier one, see?

[340] 1807.96s - 1812.82s
It's about this much, plus or minus percentage is similar, but this one, this is a lot.

[341] 1812.82s - 1817.86s
This one is little, this is even less, comes back a lot again, oh little again, this is a lot.

[342] 1819.86s - 1822.48s
Looks like it's doing well, it's running then suddenly shoots up.

[343] 1823.36s - 1832.58s
Follow it in, thinking it'll go further, but this type of trend, they consider, Westerners consider.

[344] 1833.16s - 1839.68s
It's not very strong, why it shoots up like this, but if you look at the big picture.

[345] 1839.68s - 1852.46s
They look at this as, this is learning about waves, not candlesticks.

[346] 1852.66s - 1855.74s
It's like, if driving uphill, gradually step on the accelerator.

[347] 1857.44s - 1858.72s
Finally step full max.

[348] 1858.96s - 1861.84s
Like the road is very steep, very steep incline too.

[349] 1864.16s - 1866.18s
Runs out of power, it flows down, drops.

[350] 1866.44s - 1868.16s
Something like that.

[351] 1870.76s - 1871.96s
Okay, let's look at an example.

[352] 1873.12s - 1876.18s
Suppose we see this pattern, what do we need to do?

[353] 1877.56s - 1879.06s
We pair them up.

[354] 1879.58s - 1881.14s
Like this, look at it as waves.

[355] 1885.70s - 1892.96s
Wave number 1, then down up, then down up, then down up, down up, but we don't care about the down.

[356] 1893.30s - 1899.12s
We want to analyze the consistency of the trend following the trend direction, use the term following the trend.

[357] 1899.12s - 1904.60s
Trend direction. Low is here, higher low, higher low, higher high, higher high.

[358] 1904.60s - 1906.36s
Therefore, this is clearly an uptrend.

[359] 1911.14s - 1927.12s
Following this, it's going up this way, up way, up way, up way, not down at all, let's do it again, this is not down way. Now let's analyze the first pair, rises to this point then drops down here, this is

[360] 1927.12s - 1928.78s
the return, return, the first pair.

[361] 1929.38s - 1931.96s
Let me explain simply. One, two, three, there are three pairs.

[362] 1932.34s - 1933.98s
Like the first pair, like this, we'll see that

[363] 1934.22s - 1936.44s
it's quite long and strong, then drops down.

[364] 1938.16s - 1941.18s
When it drops, it doesn't drop much. See? Doesn't drop much.

[365] 1942.16s - 1944.96s
Doesn't exceed, probably doesn't exceed 50% of

[366] 1946.78s - 1949.08s
the wave that surged up following the trend.

[367] 1949.48s - 1951.88s
So it should be classified around

[368] 1951.88s - 1964.30s
probably the type of wave we just learned, not A then B, should be around this. Now when it rises again, the second pair, pair it up again

[369] 1965.56s - 1966.10s
Ah

[370] 1967.74s - 1976.00s
You'll see that the second one that rises is actually shorter than this one.

[371] 1976.90s - 1985.16s
This means this one is strong, because the second wave is less strong than the first wave.

[372] 1987.50s - 2000.44s
And when it reverses back down, if you measure the height coming down, it probably exceeds 50% of the wave that pushed up in the same direction as the trend.

[373] 2001.04s - 2015.22s
Drops down, should exceed 50%, should be yes, should be around 50% or, if it's here, suppose 50% is here, then it exceeds, should definitely exceed 50% at this point.

[374] 2015.22s - 2022.56s
This shows the strength of this wave set is weaker than this wave set. This is already an important point, starting to weaken.

[375] 2024.38s - 2029.10s
Then the last one, it just keeps going, ah, like the type we learned, ah

[376] 2029.36s - 2036.04s
Just now, right, that it's not consistent. Strong, weak, strong, and look at the drop point. Drops

[377] 2036.04s - 2042.94s
a little, drops a lot. This trend is weakening, which might not be finished weakening yet.

[378] 2042.94s - 2045.92s
Might drop further, or it might continue up, we don't know yet.

[379] 2046.26s - 2048.02s
Just analyzing only the waves first.

[380] 2049.30s - 2050.72s
Take what we see clearly.

[381] 2051.54s - 2052.76s
We can say that

[382] 2052.76s - 2054.60s
this wave at the beginning

[383] 2054.94s - 2055.68s
was strong.

[384] 2055.68s - 2057.72s
Look at the first pair, first set.

[385] 2058.44s - 2059.22s
Surges like this.

[386] 2059.56s - 2061.88s
Here, suppose this might be Sideways, I don't know.

[387] 2061.88s - 2063.94s
But when it starts becoming a Trend, it surges really strong.

[388] 2065.32s - 2066.38s
Then pulls back just a little bit.

[389] 2066.52s - 2069.58s
Has a chance to continue, of course. See? If we follow, this is Type

[390] 2070.42s - 2073.20s
wave type, Type A, rises then pulls back a little, not reaching 50

[391] 2073.46s - 2076.48s
or around 50, it can continue far. If we count from

[392] 2076.48s - 2079.16s
this first set, it can continue this much.

[393] 2079.16s - 2081.70s
It rises like this, still going far following

[394] 2082.38s - 2083.24s
the energy of

[395] 2083.24s - 2091.18s
like this set, it pulls back a lot, it pulls back a lot, it does rise further, that's true, but it looks weak.

[396] 2093.74s - 2101.42s
Tired already, might not go as far as this one that sent, sent the whole set forward to this one, can you imagine?

[397] 2103.66s - 2107.02s
Looking at the second one, it's starting to weaken compared to the first.

[398] 2107.78s - 2116.42s
Therefore, the third one rises as strong as the first. If you look at the length, they're similar.

[399] 2118.76s - 2126.86s
Therefore, the overall picture, if we analyze it, the health is still considered good.

[400] 2128.24s - 2130.68s
Just looking at these three rises, because this part isn't finished yet.

[401] 2130.68s - 2135.50s
If we see the end part, we'll know whether the health is very good or not so good.

[402] 2135.50s - 2139.64s
If we see it pulls back only this much, and here might be support too.

[403] 2140.72s - 2143.66s
It might turn back up and continue. This shows that if it really pulls back only this much

[404] 2144.00s - 2156.56s
it would be a Type A wave, which is A below 50, A, C, A, still considered a Grade A type wave, can still continue, has a chance to continue.

[405] 2157.20s - 2159.42s
And we analyze like this.

[406] 2160.70s - 2168.30s
Like this example, this is very strong, shoots up, this is definitely A, not reaching 50%, but the second wave is shorter than this one, much shorter.

[407] 2168.76s - 2172.12s
And drops down exceeding 50, clearly, see?

[408] 2173.64s - 2177.30s
Therefore, we'll analyze that it's not very pretty.

[409] 2179.18s - 2183.40s
Rising like this, health is not very good.

[410] 2184.70s - 2188.70s
It might rise at most to around the previous High at this point.

[411] 2189.28s - 2192.22s
Then it could reverse down. The health is already not good.

[412] 2192.22s - 2195.70s
It rises well here, but here it's not so good.

[413] 2197.76s - 2202.44s
This is analyzing as waves, not looking at candlesticks yet, it's like a line chart.

[414] 2204.40s - 2208.50s
Dare to buy? Just buy. If you look at it as an uptrend, it's still lifting the Low.

[415] 2208.50s - 2211.24s
This is Low, Higher Low, Higher Low.

[416] 2211.74s - 2214.26s
High also gets higher, higher.

[417] 2214.26s - 2219.12s
But even though it can make it go up, it probably won't be strong.

[418] 2219.12s - 2222.58s
I analyze that it's not strong enough to go very far over there.

[419] 2222.94s - 2225.82s
Might come to around here, just past this high a little bit.

[420] 2226.56s - 2231.20s
Then gradually form a downtrend on the other side instead.

[421] 2233.98s - 2240.08s
Now we come to estimating the waves that will occur in the future.

[422] 2241.38s - 2245.98s
We look at the consistency. 185, 274, 209.

[423] 2247.20s - 2250.78s
On average, it should move around 200 if it continues up.

[424] 2250.78s - 2253.38s
Because this is an uptrend. See?

[425] 2254.44s - 2257.04s
Low lifts throughout, High rises throughout.

[426] 2257.66s - 2261.28s
If the hypothesis of the trend still exists, it means

[427] 2261.70s - 2266.34s
when there's a High, uh, Low that's higher here

[428] 2266.34s - 2275.96s
there's a chance for a High, uh, High that's even higher to occur.

[429] 2275.96s - 2279.88s
Around 200 pips, plus or minus, around this.

[430] 2282.40s - 2290.08s
Now the Trend will keep going according to the uptrend or downtrend direction, following the Concept theory.

[431] 2290.74s - 2301.96s
Until the Concept is violated, then we can say there's a chance for that trend to change.

[432] 2303.58s - 2307.70s
The candlestick patterns we used to memorize before, various reversal candlesticks

[433] 2308.26s - 2311.90s
Candlesticks don't indicate that the Trend will change or reverse.

[434] 2311.90s - 2314.72s
They just indicate a reversal in that specific price range only.

[435] 2316.40s - 2321.12s
Like when we see a reversal candlestick, a Pinbar just reverses this much. It doesn't say

[436] 2322.50s - 2326.76s
that the trend changes. Like where's good? Like here, this Pinbar

[437] 2327.58s - 2331.76s
drops down then rises back up. It doesn't mean that when you see a Pinbar or reversal candlestick pattern

[438] 2331.76s - 2338.70s
it will become an uptrend from a downtrend. It just changes the angle.

[439] 2338.70s - 2342.74s
The angle of price, making swing high swing low, that's all, and it still follows the same trend.

[440] 2344.46s - 2348.98s
The market moves in trends, Dow Theory point 2 says this, therefore

[441] 2349.84s - 2352.66s
You must believe it's a trend, and trade with the trend.

[442] 2353.84s - 2356.08s
And it will change trend only when it changes trend.

[443] 2356.44s - 2358.56s
Saying it like this sounds confusing but it's really like this.

[444] 2359.04s - 2361.90s
For it to change, it must violate the theory.

[445] 2361.90s - 2363.68s
Contradict it.

[446] 2365.70s - 2367.32s
Lower High, Lower High, Lower High.

[447] 2367.32s - 2368.94s
Lower Low, Lower Low, Lower Low.

[448] 2368.94s - 2372.62s
What should follow the downtrend direction?

[449] 2373.02s - 2375.42s
Lower High, Lower High, continuously lower.

[450] 2375.42s - 2379.62s
But it makes a High that's higher than the previous High here. See?

[451] 2380.38s - 2384.90s
This is violating, violating the theory.

[452] 2386.10s - 2394.38s
Therefore, there's a chance that it will change trend. Using the word chance.

[453] 2394.38s - 2400.08s
Must keep watching. Don't see just this and assume it's certain. It might just be temporary then drop again.

[454] 2400.40s - 2405.08s
Therefore, we need to watch. When it pulls back, we look at the rise that we pair up like we learned from the beginning, rises

[455] 2405.08s - 2413.52s
If it pulls back, pulls back and gets a lower, uh, gets here, gets a Higher Low, a low that's higher than this low.

[456] 2417.20s - 2421.76s
One, two, three, we get 3 components already. Low, High, Higher Low.

[457] 2422.32s - 2427.60s
If it continues moving higher than this High, becoming a Higher High, it's an uptrend.

[458] 2427.90s - 2434.02s
The trend change happens around this time, or it might drop, not stay here.

[459] 2434.02s - 2440.98s
It might drop all the way here, but not lower than this, not lower than this original Low, then it rises again.

[460] 2442.66s - 2450.30s
Until it's higher than this High, it's also an uptrend. The theory concept is when the wave breaks out of the concept.

[461] 2450.84s - 2453.76s
Of downtrend and then uptrend.

[462] 2454.80s - 2458.14s
If the pattern comes to this point really, it will fit the pattern that

[463] 2458.14s - 2461.06s
we remember as Double Bottom.

[464] 2461.56s - 2466.12s
A W shape. Two bottom points then the trend changes upward.

[465] 2467.18s - 2471.12s
According to theory, they consider the W pattern

[466] 2472.02s - 2475.52s
in a downtrend, if Double Bottom occurs, it's a Pattern

[467] 2475.98s - 2484.60s
for trend change. But really, if we take the real thing, there will be a price or wave that warns us first that it might change.

[468] 2484.60s - 2505.50s
It's this wave that breaks through the High, breaks through the concept. See? Higher than this High.

[469] 2505.50s - 2509.50s
The Low doesn't have a lifted low anymore. It has a suddenly lower low appearing like this.

[470] 2511.36s - 2515.70s
Like this example, it's clearly lower, it's clearly a downtrend.

[471] 2516.38s - 2520.46s
If this doesn't go up and drops with the downtrend, clearly it has changed.

[472] 2522.02s - 2524.78s
It's a warning signal. Simply put, we look at warning signals.

[473] 2525.18s - 2535.82s
If you've been happily playing Buy, holding long, and you see a warning signal, prepare to sell out, close TP already. Something like that.

[474] 2535.82s - 2543.60s
If you keep holding, it might come back to the point where you bought. Same if you've been selling, held it, it might come back up.

[475] 2544.52s - 2549.46s
It's a warning. However you say it, it's a warning. Remember this signal, End of Trend.

[476] 2549.46s - 2553.58s
And that's the end of this Part on the topic of Trends in Dow Theory for now.

[477] 2553.96s - 2559.88s
Next time we meet, we'll take everything and combine it all together, then we'll analyze charts together.

[478] 2560.10s - 2563.96s
That will be very fun and you'll understand much more.

[479] 2564.32s - 2566.54s
Okay, thank you very much. Goodbye.
