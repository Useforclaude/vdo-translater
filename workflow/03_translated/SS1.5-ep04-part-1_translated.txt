[Segment 0] 1.880s → 11.040s
Let's look at some chart examples now. We've studied the theory.

[Segment 1] 11.040s → 23.760s
Starting with something simple first - support and resistance like this.

[Segment 2] 24.180s → 31.760s
Price reverses like this, and there will be candlesticks.

[Segment 3] 34.100s → 38.740s
Occurring at this point and this point - there are 3 types, remember?

[Segment 4] 38.740s → 50.580s
The balance scale - Action and Reaction.

[Segment 5] 51.700s → 56.800s
There are 3 patterns - balanced, or heavier on one side or the other.

[Segment 6] 56.800s → 60.900s
Let's see how this plays out when applied to real charts.

[Segment 7] 61.220s → 66.920s
Let's look at the important support and resistance points first.

[Segment 8] 68.780s → 78.680s
Let me scroll and look. This point here is important support.

[Segment 9] 78.980s → 79.380s
Right here.

[Segment 10] 79.880s → 81.760s
Zoom in to look. Right here.

[Segment 11] 84.500s → 86.000s
We'll see price bouncing back.

[Segment 12] 90.280s → 91.620s
Just like the theory taught.

[Segment 13] 92.020s → 96.980s
See how here it moves down like this, right?

[Segment 14] 97.580s → 101.720s
But this section drops normally, and then there's a part where it becomes...

[Segment 15] 102.800s → 104.940s
The high part sticking out - what's that called? Sideways.

[Segment 16] 106.580s → 109.140s
It's like this, right?

[Segment 17] 109.440s → 115.200s
Comes down like this, and here is the consolidation zone - Sideway, see?

[Segment 18] 115.200s → 120.600s
Moving Sideway like this. We'll come back to look at this part later.

[Segment 19] 121.120s → 126.220s
Let's look at other examples first. Alright, now we'll see that here...

[Segment 20] 126.220s → 139.360s
This candle first - it swings down and then comes back up.

[Segment 21] 139.360s → 144.100s
Looking at the Action side - the side that pushed down - and Reaction going up.

[Segment 22] 144.420s → 151.340s
We have Action which is this candle, but we have no Reaction at all. See?

[Segment 23] 151.340s → 157.460s
Coming back, there's no candle that exceeds this axis candle going up.

[Segment 24] 157.460s → 163.700s
The axis is marked here - this is the axis. There's nothing, which means price...

[Segment 25] 163.700s → 167.040s
In the direction of price movement, there's no candle that made...

[Segment 26] 167.040s → 170.120s
A higher high anymore. So price obviously has to...

[Segment 27] 170.120s → 174.520s
Go down, that's it. No matter what, it has to drop.

[Segment 28] 178.200s → 181.260s
Now when it drops, let's see if it does the same thing here.

[Segment 29] 181.840s → 186.520s
See? Here it becomes... ah, I'm going to change the marker.

[Segment 30] 186.520s → 190.160s
Coming up to here, this becomes the highest point.

[Segment 31] 190.620s → 193.400s
And this one here, at the end of this candle...

[Segment 32] 193.660s → 198.200s
This point becomes the new axis instead. See? This is the axis candle.

[Segment 33] 199.300s → 205.060s
The tip - this tip here - is at the highest price of this one.

[Segment 34] 205.060s → 207.100s
Mark this candle first because you can see it, see? Right here.

[Segment 35] 207.100s → 215.080s
Zoom in. Which one? Right here, see?

[Segment 36] 215.080s → 220.100s
The tip is here. This becomes the axis because this is the highest swing point.

[Segment 37] 220.440s → 225.180s
Now we find Action and Reaction. This line - I'll make the line...

[Segment 38] 225.400s → 228.440s
Change color a bit. Because if I don't change it, the lines will look the same.

[Segment 39] 228.440s → 233.900s
So it's here, and looking at this side - the green side coming up...

[Segment 40] 234.120s → 237.500s
Action is the green side - is there a candle that exceeds and wins? Not this one.

[Segment 41] 237.500s → 243.600s
Already there. We need opposite colors - they have to be different colors.

[Segment 42] 243.960s → 250.560s
But the axis can be any color. This one here - found it.

[Segment 43] 250.560s → 257.580s
Draw a line at the tip here. See how this one compares to that one?

[Segment 44] 257.580s → 260.980s
This one wins. See? It dropped lower, which means...

[Segment 45] 261.580s → 270.920s
Action - look - Action has more power than Reaction, so it will drop...

[Segment 46] 270.920s → 274.560s
Lower than this low for sure. So price just plunges down like this.

[Segment 47] 274.560s → 281.240s
Breaking down, see how it just keeps going? This one tries to go up but has no strength.

[Segment 48] 281.240s → 284.700s
See? Can't rally back higher than this one.

[Segment 49] 285.760s → 294.320s
Not enough power to reach this zone. But the downside force says it has more power, so it just takes price down.

[Segment 50] 295.320s → 304.040s
Price drops down to this point. Can it come back up and beat this one? Let's look again.

[Segment 51] 305.400s → 311.700s
This is the lowest, right? Draw down to here - the lowest tip. This is the axis, correct?

[Segment 52] 314.160s → 321.100s
And find its price at the tip where it bounced up - the highest one here. Mark it.

[Segment 53] 322.600s → 330.900s
So let's continue looking - the Action side is this one, the opposite side...

[Segment 54] 332.080s → 333.160s
Comes up about this much.

[Segment 55] 333.400s → 333.600s
Right.

[Segment 56] 334.480s → 343.520s
Look at this - see how it exceeds half? Comparing them, they're evenly matched, so it can't beat this High going back up.

[Segment 57] 343.520s → 350.240s
These forces trying to push back up can't make it. Just gets up about this much.

[Segment 58] 350.240s → 354.780s
From Season 1, if you read Momentum, you'll already see this is the mother candle.

[Segment 59] 356.580s → 360.300s
Can't come in to attack or kill the mother candle here.

[Segment 60] 360.620s → 362.580s
So this army wins. This is the main force.

[Segment 61] 362.580s → 364.500s
These are small forces, decoy forces, medium forces.

[Segment 62] 364.500s → 365.860s
Still can't make it in the end.

[Segment 63] 365.860s → 367.940s
Gets beaten back every time anyway.

[Segment 64] 367.940s → 369.920s
This is if you're reading momentum.

[Segment 65] 369.920s → 373.120s
If you're reading purely reversal candlestick patterns...

[Segment 66] 373.120s → 375.480s
Just follow this method.

[Segment 67] 375.780s → 379.260s
You can call it Action Reaction or the balance scale candlestick pattern.

[Segment 68] 379.860s → 382.660s
You get this characteristic. We've seen it can't win.

[Segment 69] 383.080s → 385.640s
Comes up to here, then let's move and look...

[Segment 70] 385.640s → 390.560s
Does it have downward momentum to continue? The red - you'll see the red is higher.

[Segment 71] 391.160s → 392.540s
I'll mark at the red candle.

[Segment 72] 393.240s → 401.600s
Here. Once I mark the red candle, it's at the price that came down to the red body - not the wick.

[Segment 73] 401.600s → 408.840s
And look at Action versus Reaction - moving this - make this line thinner.

[Segment 74] 408.840s → 415.340s
And make it a tip line. Who has a tip? Use a tip instead.

[Segment 75] 415.340s → 420.480s
Like this - this is the axis. Find the Action and Reaction buying - where is it?

[Segment 76] 422.200s → 425.240s
The one exceeding on this side - this one doesn't count because it's absorbed...

[Segment 77] 425.240s → 428.180s
Combined power with this one - it doesn't exceed.

[Segment 78] 428.180s → 433.020s
This one exceeds, right? Count this one. Once we count it, draw a line.

[Segment 79] 436.060s → 439.120s
Like this here. See how this red candle wins?

[Segment 80] 439.120s → 444.480s
Which means Action force is higher, so it can break through this low going down.

[Segment 81] 444.480s → 447.820s
It can break lower, so it does. Now if you're trading and you see this...

[Segment 82] 448.520s → 454.240s
Instead of waiting to buy, waiting to find the buy point for a reversal, you can just follow the steps.

[Segment 83] 454.240s → 460.000s
Following the steps means - let's say you saw it from which point...

[Segment 84] 460.000s → 464.600s
At this point you're not sure if it will come back up, but once you see the signal here...

[Segment 85] 465.220s → 469.420s
You can sell going down. And where do you place stop loss? Right here.

[Segment 86] 470.160s → 474.360s
It flows down. Comes back up here - add more sells if you want, stop loss stays here.

[Segment 87] 476.200s → 480.380s
Sell - it keeps selling down. Price keeps dropping because we know it will drop.

[Segment 88] 480.380s → 486.980s
Because we measured the force we saw from this pattern. So it drops...

[Segment 89] 486.980s → 494.160s
Down to here, down to here, then we look again. Which one becomes the new axis?

[Segment 90] 494.160s → 498.180s
The lowest one is this one. See?

[Segment 91] 498.180s → 503.300s
Find both prices - where's the tip here? This one. Check Action versus Reaction again.

[Segment 92] 503.300s → 509.680s
Coming across to the edge. See how Action - that's right...

[Segment 93] 509.680s → 514.620s
Price dropping down like this - this one here. Is there any Reaction going up?

[Segment 94] 514.620s → 517.580s
Not a single winning candle here. So...

[Segment 95] 518.420s → 523.120s
Price has no way to fight back and go up. No way to reverse higher.

[Segment 96] 523.120s → 526.560s
It has to continue down. So it gradually seeps down further like this.

[Segment 97] 526.560s → 530.600s
Until reaching this point again - it's a swing point. We're tracking swings continuously like this.

[Segment 98] 531.720s → 535.620s
This swing has no upward momentum. See? It has Action but...

[Segment 99] 535.620s → 539.760s
The Reaction force - meaning the bounce back or counter-reaction reflecting back...

[Segment 100] 539.760s → 542.300s
Has no power. Can't reflect back out.

[Segment 101] 542.480s → 546.480s
So it must follow the same direction - the Trend, following its Trend.

[Segment 102] 546.800s → 549.900s
Which is downtrend. Because what does it make?

[Segment 103] 552.080s → 562.680s
High, Low, Lower High, Lower Low, Lower High, Lower Low, Lower High, Lower Low.

[Segment 104] 563.200s → 566.380s
In one direction - becoming a staircase stepping down continuously.

[Segment 105] 566.380s → 569.480s
Until meeting this one. This one stands out.

[Segment 106] 570.380s → 574.240s
Gets a new axis as this one. And is it at an important zone?

[Segment 107] 574.820s → 582.480s
This is important support here because it connects with a previous point.

[Segment 108] 582.940s → 584.800s
Bounces up from there - worth watching.

[Segment 109] 585.700s → 591.740s
So - is it important support? Let's use it, consider it.

[Segment 110] 591.740s → 599.980s
Coming down - marking the lowest point here. At...

[Segment 111] 599.980s → 604.500s
Its tip here. And looking left and right - this one exceeds by a full candle.

[Segment 112] 604.500s → 608.260s
Half of it is here. So this one exceeds - mark it first.

[Segment 113] 609.860s → 614.880s
Like this. And this side - does this candle count? This one. See - it exceeds...

[Segment 114] 615.260s → 619.900s
Half should be about here, but this doesn't reach. Which means its force...

[Segment 115] 619.900s → 623.200s
These two are basically the same. They're absorbing each other's energy.

[Segment 116] 623.200s → 628.020s
So we have to count this one. Count this one. There's a line - where'd the line go?

[Segment 117] 628.880s → 639.580s
Three lines. Get another one. See? This one can beat that one.

[Segment 118] 639.580s → 644.560s
This one. Comparing this to that one - this is higher. Close is higher.

[Segment 119] 645.040s → 651.860s
The candle is higher. So in a Reaction scenario, it has more power.

[Segment 120] 652.500s → 656.740s
It's starting already - this one has more power compared to that one. See?

[Segment 121] 657.980s → 663.380s
Stronger than this one. Stronger than the previous one that had no Reaction side at all.

[Segment 122] 663.380s → 667.320s
Which means this has higher power. So the High around this area...

[Segment 123] 667.500s → 673.240s
Will be hit. Has a chance to be hit. So price can go above it.

[Segment 124] 673.500s → 675.680s
Yeah. So price will run and rise up.

[Segment 125] 675.680s → 683.160s
Gradually going up, and eventually comes above it for real. And consolidates. See? Consolidates then makes a new swing.

[Segment 126] 683.840s → 691.700s
Look again. Check this new point - will price continue or will it drop like this? Here, clear this first.

[Segment 127] 701.720s → 712.100s
So which one becomes the axis? Going down - swinging, following this. Use this one as the axis.

[Segment 128] 715.160s → 721.220s
Following here, see? Balance scale. Get the balance scale shape? Go to the tip, body only.

[Segment 129] 725.060s → 730.240s
At the red. This is Action, this is Reaction. See how Reaction wins? See?

[Segment 130] 730.240s → 733.820s
So price continues up. The High is here already.

[Segment 131] 736.580s → 740.160s
High is here. See? The connection zone like this.

[Segment 132] 742.020s → 745.920s
Price rallies from here upward, running up.

[Segment 133] 746.600s → 751.000s
Because here the Reaction force is higher - this is...

[Segment 134] 751.460s → 758.080s
Action and Reaction. This one pushes through up, until beating this High.

[Segment 135] 761.000s → 767.080s
Can it continue? Already beat the High. I said it can reach the High.

[Segment 136] 767.580s → 772.740s
As for whether it consolidates after reaching the High - like this point where it beat the High then consolidated and continued...

[Segment 137] 772.740s → 776.800s
Or consolidates then reverses - either is possible. We have to consider.

[Segment 138] 777.680s → 782.820s
What price is hinting to us - this one, the highest is here.

[Segment 139] 782.820s → 790.300s
Draw up to here, see? The highest point is here - this red candle is the axis candle.

[Segment 140] 790.300s → 794.220s
See the axis candle? Look left and right the same way - looking to the left...

[Segment 141] 795.000s → 801.340s
This candle no, no, no - this candle, see? Coming up, mark at this candle.

[Segment 142] 801.900s → 811.840s
And looking at the right side - this is Action. Now we find the Reaction side. See? Reaction dropped, coming down this much.

[Segment 143] 812.320s → 820.620s
Strong? Very strong. Came up very strong. This one said it can go up, and it did go up already. Did its job here.

[Segment 144] 821.000s → 825.680s
But coming down, comparing forces with this one - looking at power, it's much higher than this.

[Segment 145] 825.680s → 830.300s
So it pushes and slaps price down quite hard like this.

[Segment 146] 830.560s → 834.180s
It might not just pullback and continue - it drops hard like this.

[Segment 147] 835.120s → 838.780s
Drops hard, drops long and easy, almost breaks through support.

[Segment 148] 839.020s → 842.500s
Broke already - yeah broke already, actually broke down. Because this one has way more strength.

[Segment 149] 843.740s → 847.160s
Comparing both sides' power - between this one going up and this one going down...

[Segment 150] 847.160s → 849.880s
This one has more power. See?

[Segment 151] 851.720s → 854.540s
Geography is sensitive here - they win by just a little, see?

[Segment 152] 854.780s → 856.860s
Win by just a little between this green and this red.

[Segment 153] 858.000s → 864.260s
But this balance scale - this red versus this green - wins by a lot.

[Segment 154] 864.260s → 868.760s
So this one's downward force is much stronger. Takes it down like this.

[Segment 155] 869.340s → 873.060s
Once it takes it down like this, we continue watching. Clear these markers first.

[Segment 156] 879.580s → 883.740s
It becomes this point. We draw across - there. Like this.

[Segment 157] 883.740s → 888.200s
This one becomes the new balance scale, new axis balance scale.

[Segment 158] 891.680s → 897.560s
Mark around this area. See anything? Looking back at this side - can use this one.

[Segment 159] 897.560s → 902.060s
This is the Action side. And Reaction? Does it exceed half?

[Segment 160] 902.060s → 907.400s
This one exceeds half, but loses to this one. See?

[Segment 161] 907.400s → 913.720s
This pattern loses to this one. So it can't beat this High.

[Segment 162] 913.720s → 927.000s
And it keeps dropping, dropping, dropping...

[Segment 163] 927.980s → 933.220s
Gets this candle - this one. Red here - not this red.

[Segment 164] 933.220s → 936.700s
This red. Small red - small because it already gave away half. Already gave away...

[Segment 165] 936.700s → 940.520s
Half already. But where's the green? Green gets here. Does it have strength? Yes.

[Segment 166] 940.520s → 956.980s
Stronger. See? So it will make a higher high.

[Segment 167] 956.980s → 964.360s
Talking about reversal points - reversal points look like this.

[Segment 168] 964.360s → 967.740s
Reversal point like this, see? Violent - going up fine then slaps down.

[Segment 169] 968.420s → 972.540s
Ends in Sideway like this, then we'll talk later. This one - downtrend coming down long.

[Segment 170] 973.020s → 978.460s
Meets this point, it reverses upward. Reverse in terms of becoming an uptrend going up.

[Segment 171] 979.380s → 984.020s
See the subtraction? All gone. Now it's an uptrend.

[Segment 172] 984.020s → 987.600s
Coming up, coming up long. Starting from here.

[Segment 173] 987.600s → 990.820s
Coming up like this, then it flips back, right? Flips back to being like this.

[Segment 174] 991.200s → 996.860s
Same thing. We look at it the same way. We find...

[Segment 175] 996.860s → 1001.860s
Following this - it will have... from the lowest point inside...

[Segment 176] 1004.880s → 1008.900s
If counting, this one might be the one that broke through the swing.

[Segment 177] 1008.900s → 1010.480s
But we don't use it. It's not a swing point.

[Segment 178] 1010.480s → 1013.660s
It's not the characteristic of down then up.

[Segment 179] 1014.020s → 1018.440s
It's just one of the candlestick formations along the way, this one.

[Segment 180] 1021.020s → 1025.700s
Actually it might be this one. Use this one - we look at both sides.

[Segment 181] 1026.980s → 1036.580s
Comparing them. What we get is the red candle - gets this whole side.

[Segment 182] 1036.960s → 1040.780s
Red is this one. Green is this one. See how they can't compete?

[Segment 183] 1041.420s → 1046.140s
This is High-derm - it can't Hi-derm through immediately.

[Segment 184] 1046.680s → 1051.540s
See how it reaches then pullbacks down to consolidate here?

[Segment 185] 1051.540s → 1057.640s
So the axis would be here. Price continues going up.

[Segment 186] 1058.660s → 1063.760s
The Action side - red - versus Reaction side - green - doesn't exceed.

[Segment 187] 1063.760s → 1068.340s
Half of it is at the midpoint. This one is at the midpoint, half.

[Segment 188] 1068.340s → 1071.960s
Maybe doesn't quite reach, so doesn't count. We count this one. See? It can continue.

[Segment 189] 1071.960s → 1074.260s
So it can make a higher high than this High.

[Segment 190] 1074.260s → 1076.040s
Which means price will continue running.

[Segment 191] 1076.040s → 1078.880s
Now we start seeing Trend because it's starting to become Low...

[Segment 192] 1081.240s → 1084.740s
High-Low and got High-High going up already. See?

[Segment 193] 1084.740s → 1088.100s
Going up, going up long.

[Segment 194] 1089.940s → 1092.400s
Actually, we can compare many things. Measuring force...

[Segment 195] 1092.400s → 1096.700s
Here is less, here is more. Measuring force here compared to...

[Segment 196] 1096.700s → 1099.620s
Here - more. Because, see how it ran...

[Segment 197] 1100.500s → 1115.620s
Further. This is one part - there's a clue, a hint.

[Segment 198] 1115.620s → 1118.460s
Sitting and reading candle tiers like this can be tiring.

[Segment 199] 1118.460s → 1120.240s
You find this period is very important anyway.

[Segment 200] 1120.240s → 1122.080s
This one - let's be careful with this.

[Segment 201] 1122.320s → 1125.940s
For those who studied Season 2 already - you can see the future here.

[Segment 202] 1125.940s → 1129.680s
From this point to here, you already know where price will go next, approximately.

[Segment 203] 1129.680s → 1131.500s
Very clearly.

[Segment 204] 1132.240s → 1133.120s
Very clearly.

[Segment 205] 1135.400s → 1137.120s
Price runs up to here.

[Segment 206] 1137.120s → 1142.840s
And we move on, move on, move on - it becomes this point.

[Segment 207] 1143.260s → 1149.940s
See? Here. Comparing them. It dropped momentarily, but actually this one...

[Segment 208] 1149.940s → 1154.140s
Looks more like this one. But remember, whatever technique...

[Segment 209] 1154.140s → 1165.560s
We've talked about - on the day they learned up to...

[Segment 210] 1165.560s → 1169.180s
Higher Low. When it reaches this point, we don't know yet. It might continue dropping.

[Segment 211] 1169.180s → 1172.400s
We might be looking at the chart. Let's say we don't know yet. We see this shape...

[Segment 212] 1172.780s → 1176.000s
Hey, will it slap down to here? It has a chance.

[Segment 213] 1176.420s → 1179.260s
But it doesn't slap - it comes down here then bounces back up like this.

[Segment 214] 1179.260s → 1183.800s
We have to reconsider. Reconsider.

[Segment 215] 1184.420s → 1187.420s
After reconsidering, it still doesn't look strong. Here it can only go up a little.

[Segment 216] 1187.420s → 1193.420s
Compared to here it went up a lot. See here? Do you see the Action and Reaction here?

[Segment 217] 1194.060s → 1200.240s
Coming down to here already. This green candle works. This red wins. Action wins, Reaction is small.

[Segment 218] 1200.240s → 1204.580s
So it shouldn't go far. But it might... it might break through. It shouldn't break though.

[Segment 219] 1204.580s → 1208.320s
But it does break. What shouldn't happen, but does happen...

[Segment 220] 1208.320s → 1212.020s
What will happen next is - it will get pushed back down harder than before.

[Segment 221] 1212.340s → 1215.900s
Like this. It doesn't just consolidate and continue.

[Segment 222] 1215.900s → 1225.720s
It comes up, breaks this High - true. Breaks it - true. But eventually price gets pushed back down lower than before. See?

[Segment 223] 1226.120s → 1231.120s
It shouldn't have made it, but it did. So it will be pushed back down harder than before anyway.

[Segment 224] 1232.920s → 1237.820s
From the signals we read. This will slap hard because we'll see signals here already.

[Segment 225] 1237.820s → 1243.980s
The axis. Balance scale on the other side - it slaps down on this side. Looking at this side...

[Segment 226] 1244.620s → 1249.200s
It would be moved here, right? This is it. This side - is there anything?

[Segment 227] 1252.120s → 1258.520s
Nothing at all. So price can't. It's hard to push through...

[Segment 228] 1262.740s → 1266.860s
Through this zone easily. And it doesn't go through at all. See?

[Segment 229] 1266.860s → 1271.400s
Goes up then down, down, down. Goes up then down. But gradually lifting up.

[Segment 230] 1271.800s → 1279.740s
We gradually measure its force continuously. This point. Coming to this point.

[Segment 231] 1279.740s → 1283.820s
Thinking red versus green - lower. Red is lower. The red one...

[Segment 232] 1291.280s → 1294.380s
This one exceeds toward the direction. Count this one. Don't count that one. Count this.

[Segment 233] 1295.000s → 1299.100s
And look at the green. This one doesn't count - they're absorbing each other. Same group.

[Segment 234] 1299.100s → 1300.860s
This one breaks out quite a bit.

[Segment 235] 1300.860s → 1303.860s
From previously small, becoming big like this.

[Segment 236] 1303.860s → 1321.100s
So the chance to continue running until breaking through here, making a new High...

[Segment 237] 1321.100s → 1323.760s
It still goes up. Once it goes up...

[Segment 238] 1325.300s → 1327.480s
Then we look at the next point again.

[Segment 239] 1328.340s → 1330.820s
This is an uptrend candle - this one is the center.

[Segment 240] 1332.960s → 1334.460s
Right here. Mark at this point.

[Segment 241] 1335.300s → 1336.540s
So this side - what do we count?

[Segment 242] 1336.540s → 1339.940s
Count this one, right? Green is Action, and red is Reaction.

[Segment 243] 1340.360s → 1341.000s
It's small.

[Segment 244] 1342.120s → 1345.580s
It's small. So it might drop a bit then continue.

[Segment 245] 1345.920s → 1346.080s
Coming...

[Segment 246] 1346.940s → 1362.920s
So it drops down but can't go lower than the previous low because Reaction is small. This side has small Reaction, so it pullbacks down but can't go lower than the previous low. It becomes this low - it doesn't go lower. Comes down about this much. Still lifting - the low keeps lifting up like this.

[Segment 247] 1363.520s → 1365.320s
Higher Low, Higher Low, Higher Low.

[Segment 248] 1367.020s → 1369.220s
But what we'll see next is...

[Segment 249] 1369.220s → 1370.860s
From this point onward...

[Segment 250] 1371.120s → 1373.800s
The uptrend from here on...

[Segment 251] 1373.800s → 1377.080s
It's stuck - no Reaction force anymore.

[Segment 252] 1377.080s → 1380.700s
Coming down like this - no more Reaction.

[Segment 253] 1381.080s → 1383.620s
Becomes having Action but Reaction side, see?

[Segment 254] 1383.620s → 1385.140s
No green candle exceeding this one.

[Segment 255] 1385.140s → 1388.380s
Going up - just one tiny bit. Nothing.

[Segment 256] 1388.800s → 1392.300s
It won't be like when it was coming up during this period - wherever you touch...

[Segment 257] 1392.300s → 1397.640s
There's still green. Even if it had little power - Reaction small means returns are small, or can't push through...

[Segment 258] 1397.640s → 1401.040s
Then has to come down to form again. It will have its patterns continuously.

[Segment 259] 1401.040s → 1406.020s
Like this side, like this pattern, see? This red one - it's very similar to this.

[Segment 260] 1406.020s → 1410.320s
See this red? Is there a green mark? No. So it doesn't push through.

[Segment 261] 1410.600s → 1431.020s
Actually this one might be indicating that the trend is about to end.

[Segment 262] 1431.020s → 1436.760s
It's forcing it. Forcing already. Same here - looks like it should've ended here.

[Segment 263] 1438.620s → 1444.060s
From Season 2 perspective, you'll already see it should've ended here. Should've dropped from here.

[Segment 264] 1444.260s → 1449.760s
If we read the chart, it should start dropping. But it's forcing, it goes up.

[Segment 265] 1452.420s → 1455.280s
Was there a signal to go up? Yes there was. We just looked at it.

[Segment 266] 1455.280s → 1459.080s
Just now it just said - hey, it can go up, there's still upward momentum. So it went up.

[Segment 267] 1459.080s → 1463.740s
Eventually it drops. Once it drops, it starts saying can't go up anymore.

[Segment 268] 1463.740s → 1467.060s
It will repeat the pattern around here. Can't do it.

[Segment 269] 1467.580s → 1469.780s
But it forms again until it says it can.

[Segment 270] 1469.780s → 1475.660s
And let's see if it can form again here. It drops down, down, down...

[Segment 271] 1476.060s → 1476.400s
There.

[Segment 272] 1480.600s → 1487.420s
We count this one and this one. This one - not that one.

[Segment 273] 1487.900s → 1492.100s
See this one? It already exceeded. Its open and close are here.

[Segment 274] 1492.100s → 1498.300s
Its body is smaller than this one. So it has less strength...

[Segment 275] 1498.300s → 1504.360s
To push through to here. And it gets trapped back down like this. See?

[Segment 276] 1504.360s → 1508.020s
It has its signals telling us continuously like this. This is reading for...

[Segment 277] 1510.460s → 1516.060s
Reversals. Like this - let's look at its shape. If it's a Pattern, you'll see...

[Segment 278] 1516.820s → 1521.680s
It has characteristics kind of cutting out like this.

[Segment 279] 1523.280s → 1526.840s
If you draw it, what does it look like? It's like Head and Shoulders.

[Segment 280] 1527.340s → 1530.980s
See? And we've studied this already.

[Segment 281] 1532.440s → 1537.160s
When dropping here, there has to be a candlestick pattern or balance scale pattern...

[Segment 282] 1537.160s → 1541.440s
That says Reaction has downward force, strong enough to push down. Which pattern?

[Segment 283] 1542.360s → 1545.960s
This pattern, right? Where it will bounce back up. At this point.

[Segment 284] 1547.360s → 1552.060s
And the red is more than the green side. This one is quite a lot.

[Segment 285] 1552.060s → 1557.240s
Eventually it takes price down with this much force. And just like we read earlier...

[Segment 286] 1557.240s → 1562.560s
It continues on and on, long, until it breaks and changes trend direction like this.

[Segment 287] 1562.560s → 1570.620s
This one is about Sideway. So about that much should be enough to understand first.

[Segment 288] 1571.040s → 1577.780s
As for this part - if we look at when it was trending up, we drew earlier that it was support, right?

[Segment 289] 1578.160s → 1585.340s
What pattern do we see? Like this. See? It has characteristics of Double Bottom.

[Segment 290] 1585.780s → 1595.740s
The first Bottom point - first point - force wasn't enough to push through. Had to come make a second force with more strength.

[Segment 291] 1595.740s → 1600.160s
Just barely pushes through. It hints like this. The balance scale hints like this.

[Segment 292] 1600.160s → 1605.380s
You sit and read it like this. Same here. This point - not enough force to push down.

[Segment 293] 1605.620s → 1610.500s
This point - not enough force to push down. But the last one has the most force. So it pushes down.

[Segment 294] 1610.500s → 1613.240s
It's like this. Because we read them together.

[Segment 295] 1613.240s → 1616.080s
This one we read just the candlesticks, the balance scale pattern only.

[Segment 296] 1616.080s → 1619.220s
The Action and Reaction pattern. If you try reading with Momentum...

[Segment 297] 1619.220s → 1623.100s
And theory, and principles from Season 2 combined...

[Segment 298] 1623.100s → 1640.480s
Even clearer - you'll see the chart picture even more clearly.

[Segment 299] 1640.960s → 1643.840s
Your entry points - you'll get them already. Forgot to talk about entry points.

[Segment 300] 1644.380s → 1646.140s
When you enter, you just let it flow continuously...

[Segment 301] 1646.140s → 1649.640s
Until you find... until you find...

[Segment 302] 1651.640s → 1654.380s
What I said will drop hard.

[Segment 303] 1654.380s → 1656.700s
Let's say you buy, right? You buy. Here you buy.

[Segment 304] 1656.700s → 1659.400s
You just let it flow continuously. Either way, weigh it.

[Segment 305] 1659.400s → 1663.280s
Until you find the point it tells you - the other side becomes a balance scale that says...

[Segment 306] 1663.280s → 1666.800s
Will drop hard. Then you exit. Exit slowly.

[Segment 307] 1667.680s → 1671.080s
Stop Loss would be here. Take Profit or Exit...

[Segment 308] 1671.080s → 1675.260s
Is about here. If you Buy - if you Sell, you Sell...

[Segment 309] 1675.260s → 1679.740s
But here. We let it flow continuously until you find the point it says...

[Segment 310] 1680.000s → 1682.980s
Won't drop anymore. There's opposite force going up.

[Segment 311] 1683.540s → 1687.400s
Then exit. That's it - just let it flow easily like this. That's all.

[Segment 312] 1687.800s → 1691.120s
We look at 3 candles, right?

[Segment 313] 1691.720s → 1695.420s
Some people don't understand. Let's say...

[Segment 314] 1695.420s → 1699.600s
You'll Buy. Buy - now we have to...

[Segment 315] 1699.600s → 1702.240s
Wait for all 3, right?

[Segment 316] 1703.280s → 1707.360s
Have to wait for 3. So if we Buy, we'll buy - the 4th candle, this zone.

[Segment 317] 1708.060s → 1715.120s
This whole area where we can buy - let price run up until meeting a new pattern we mentioned...

[Segment 318] 1715.120s → 1721.760s
That might not be trustworthy anymore, better to exit. Same thing. If you'll Sell going down...

[Segment 319] 1722.600s → 1727.600s
Which candle? This pattern, right? Right here.

[Segment 320] 1730.260s → 1734.380s
Count this one. Not dropping hard yet. Comes back up, this zone.

[Segment 321] 1734.380s → 1739.700s
Drops hard - if counting this one. After this candle - half the zone of this whole candle...

[Segment 322] 1739.700s → 1744.560s
You can sell anywhere in this range. This area.

[Segment 323] 1745.020s → 1749.920s
This area approximately. I count from half of this candle.

[Segment 324] 1749.920s → 1754.860s
This red candle here. Because price retraces up, swings up within the red candle zone...

[Segment 325] 1755.760s → 1758.800s
All of it - can sell to let it flow down. Same here.

[Segment 326] 1759.220s → 1763.260s
Would be around this green candle, right? This green doesn't push through.

[Segment 327] 1763.260s → 1769.540s
And we count this green candle - half of it - to catch.

[Segment 328] 1770.100s → 1774.100s
The upper half, to be sure.

[Segment 329] 1777.980s → 1780.320s
Price in this zone - you buy going up.

[Segment 330] 1780.700s → 1783.620s
Let it go until meeting the one that reverses back. That's it.

[Segment 331] 1784.760s → 1787.100s
That's it. The order entry method is very simple.

[Segment 332] 1787.100s → 1791.880s
If using the balance scale principle, or Action Reaction...

[Segment 333] 1791.880s → 1796.520s
Just look at this - did you find the reversal reflection yet?

[Segment 334] 1797.280s → 1800.460s
Let it flow continuously. However it goes, doesn't matter.

[Segment 335] 1802.080s → 1805.600s
Until it meets one with equal force - that says Reaction looks strong already.

[Segment 336] 1805.900s → 1810.800s
Exit. Entry - you enter, and it just flows continuously like this.

[Segment 337] 1811.120s → 1815.500s
You apply or combine this with understanding from Season 1...

[Segment 338] 1816.400s → 1826.500s
Those who studied the bonus already - that's another part.

[Segment 339] 1826.960s → 1830.040s
About Sideway or consolidation.
