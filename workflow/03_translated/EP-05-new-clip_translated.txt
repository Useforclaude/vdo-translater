[0001]
Hello everyone, and welcome back to the final part of Reading Charts Like Watching a Movie.

[0002]
We read charts, we view charts like we're reading a book, reading a novel, watching a movie, watching a series, watching any show we enjoy.

[0003]
If we keep following it and analyzing the plot as we go, it'll make our chart analysis more accurate and help us see another dimension.

[0004]
Beyond just drawing lines all over the place and analyzing using the common techniques that are already being taught out there.

[0005]
Like support and resistance, candlestick patterns and all that.

[0006]
How many patterns to memorize, how many pattern types there are.

[0007]
Triangle patterns.

[0008]
Different triangle types, there are so many types of triangles.

[0009]
Flags, pennants, all kinds of stuff like that.

[0010]
Instead of just memorizing all that, we'll go deeper - to the point where we don't even need to memorize.

[0011]
We understand the flow, we understand the story.

[0012]
We understand what the price wants to do, what direction it wants to go.

[0013]
Once we understand this, we'll know which way to trade.

[0014]
So today we're continuing from where we left off.

[0015]
We've covered how to read charts like reading a story.

[0016]
How each candlestick is like a character in a movie.

[0017]
Some candles are protagonists, some are villains.

[0018]
Some are supporting characters, some are extras.

[0019]
Today we're going deeper into understanding the characters.

[0020]
We need to know their personalities, their roles.

[0021]
Just like when we watch a series and we get to know each character.

[0022]
We know who's the main character, who's the villain.

[0023]
We know what each one is trying to do.

[0024]
In charts, it's the same thing.

[0025]
Each candle has its own role.

[0026]
Large candles are like main characters.

[0027]
Small candles are like extras, background characters.

[0028]
The really big, powerful candles - those are the bosses.

[0029]
Those are what we call the commanders.

[0030]
In Thai we call them "แม่ทัพ" - the major candles that lead the action.

[0031]
From Dow Theory, from the Dow theory, the story or plot direction

[0032]
Which side is the story supporting - the hero side or the villain side?

[0033]
We need to stick with them, follow along. Whichever way they're paving the road, we follow that flow.

[0034]
Be a friend of the hero or be a friend of the villain, be a follower going along with them.

[0035]
Don't go against it or the fans won't like it. If during this part of the story

[0036]
They're building up the hero to look good, the hero keeps winning

[0037]
And we go with the villain side? We'll lose. You know what I mean?

[0038]
On the flip side, if they're building up the villain to look amazing, look superior

[0039]
And we go with the hero side at that point, it might look bad - we might get beaten by the villain side

[0040]
They have the upper hand. The hero still can't turn

[0041]
The plot around, can't reverse their role to overcome the villain.

[0042]
The villain side is still dominating.

[0043]
So our job as viewers, when we practice reading charts like watching a movie

[0044]
Something we enjoy, we just watch. We look at the big picture

[0045]
Which way is it going? We follow that direction. We ride the momentum

[0046]
If the plot is favoring the hero, we follow the hero. If it favors the villain

[0047]
We follow the villain. Following the hero or villain means - if the trend is up

[0048]
We follow the uptrend

[0049]
If it's a downtrend, we trade with the downtrend, going down

[0050]
Don't fight it. Either way, we'll survive.

[0051]
But if we fight against it

[0052]
Go against the trend, we'll definitely lose

[0053]
100% we'll lose

[0054]
So that's why we need to understand which way the story is going

[0055]
Which side is dominating right now

[0056]
Once we know that, now we look at the characters

[0057]
We look at each candlestick

[0058]
Which candles are the main characters? Which are supporting characters?

[0059]
The large candles are the main characters

[0060]
The small ones are just extras

[0061]
Now when we look at the chart, when we look at the characters

[0062]
We see large candles, small candles mixed together

[0063]
Some go up, some go down, all kinds of them

[0064]
We need to identify which ones are the key characters

[0065]
If you see a really big candle

[0066]
Way bigger than the others around it

[0067]
That's a main character, that's a boss

[0068]
That's what we call a major candle

[0069]
These major candles have power

[0070]
They can change the direction of price

[0071]
If price breaks through that major candle

[0072]
It means that side has overcome the boss

[0073]
And price can continue in that direction

[0074]
But if it can't break through

[0075]
It means the boss is still holding strong

[0076]
Price will bounce back

[0077]
This is why we need to watch for these major candles

[0078]
They're like commanders in a battle

[0079]
If the commander falls, the whole army falls

[0080]
If the commander holds, the army holds

[0081]
Same thing with price action

[0082]
When you see these major candles at key levels

[0083]
At resistance or support

[0084]
Those are critical scenes in the story

[0085]
That's where the battle happens

[0086]
That's where we see if the bulls or bears will win

[0087]
Now let's look at an example

[0088]
Look at this chart here

[0089]
See this large candle? This is a major candle

[0090]
It's much bigger than the ones around it

[0091]
And it's at a resistance level

[0092]
This is a key scene

[0093]
The bulls are trying to push through

[0094]
But the bears are defending with this major candle

[0095]
See what happens next?

[0096]
Price tries to go up but keeps getting rejected

[0097]
Because this major candle is holding

[0098]
The bears are in control here

[0099]
This is their territory

[0100]
Until something changes, we trade with the bears

[0101]
Then we can decide what happens next, which way will the plot turn?

[0102]
Will it favor the hero side or will the villain side take over?

[0103]
Then we play along with that.

[0104]
Now, to know which side has the role

[0105]
We need to get to know the characters, the personality of each character.

[0106]
What's their mood like? You know?

[0107]
Like candlesticks - if a candle is this size

[0108]
A really big candle like this is considered the main character, the lead.

[0109]
The boss of the story. Whether it's the boss on the hero side or the villain side.

[0110]
Like in Game of Thrones, it'd be these two as the standouts.

[0111]
I'll use green for the hero side and red for this one.

[0112]
This green one, when I say big candle

[0113]
It's a really large candle, way bigger than the others around it.

[0114]
This is a main character.

[0115]
The small ones are just extras, background characters.

[0116]
They don't have much power or role.

[0117]
But the big ones, those are the key players.

[0118]
When you see a candle like this at a key level

[0119]
That's a major scene, an important scene.

[0120]
That's where the action happens.

[0121]
Like in a movie, there are scenes that aren't important

[0122]
Just filler, just showing daily life.

[0123]
But then there are key scenes, critical scenes.

[0124]
Where the main characters face off.

[0125]
Those are the scenes we need to pay attention to.

[0126]
Same with charts.

[0127]
There are areas where not much happens.

[0128]
Just small candles, price going sideways.

[0129]
But then there are key levels - resistance, support.

[0130]
That's where the major candles show up.

[0131]
That's where we see the battle.

[0132]
Will the bulls break through or will the bears hold?

[0133]
These major candles tell us the answer.

[0134]
If a big green candle breaks through resistance

[0135]
The bulls have won that battle.

[0136]
Price will continue up.

[0137]
But if the bears defend with a big red candle

[0138]
That tells us the bears are still in control.

[0139]
Price will go back down.

[0140]
So we need to watch for these major candles at key levels.

[0141]
They're like commanders leading their armies.

[0142]
If you see a large army, lots of volume, big candle

[0143]
That side has strength, has power.

[0144]
But if you see just a small force, small candle

[0145]
That side doesn't have much power.

[0146]
They probably can't win that battle.

[0147]
So when we analyze the chart

[0148]
We look at the big picture first - which way is the trend?

[0149]
Then we look closer at each scene.

[0150]
We look at the characters in that scene.

[0151]
That's happening around the world.

[0152]
We look at who are the main characters, who are the supporting characters.

[0153]
Who's leading the action.

[0154]
Once we see that, we know which way to trade.

[0155]
If the bulls have the big candles, the major candles

[0156]
The bulls are in control.

[0157]
We trade with the bulls.

[0158]
If the bears have the major candles

[0159]
The bears are dominating.

[0160]
We trade with the bears.

[0161]
It's that simple.

[0162]
We don't fight the main characters.

[0163]
We go with them.

[0164]
Now let's look at this in more detail.

[0165]
When we see candles at key levels

[0166]
Like here at this resistance

[0167]
Look at this candle.

[0168]
This is a major candle.

[0169]
It's way bigger than the others.

[0170]
And it formed right at resistance.

[0171]
This tells us the bears are defending strongly.

[0172]
They don't want price to break through.

[0173]
So what do we do?

[0174]
We wait and watch.

[0175]
Can the bulls overcome this major candle?

[0176]
Can they break through?

[0177]
If they can, the bulls win.

[0178]
Price goes higher.

[0179]
But if they can't

[0180]
The bears hold.

[0181]
Price bounces back down.

[0182]
This is how we read the story.

[0183]
Each candle tells us something.

[0184]
But the big ones, the major candles

[0185]
Those tell us the most important parts.

[0186]
Those are the key moments in the story.

[0187]
Now, sometimes you'll see

[0188]
Two sides that are evenly matched.

[0189]
Bulls and bears both have strength.

[0190]
In Thai we call this 'สูสี' - neck and neck.

[0191]
When you see this, be careful.

[0192]
The battle isn't decided yet.

[0193]
Wait to see who wins.

[0194]
Don't jump in too early.

[0195]
Wait for a clear winner.

[0196]
Then trade with the winner.

[0197]
This is the smart way to trade.

[0198]
Follow the story.

[0199]
Go with the main characters.

[0200]
Don't try to predict what'll happen.

[0201]
Right here. See? This big spike here.

[0202]
Just watch what happens.

[0203]
See how the story unfolds.

[0204]
Then trade accordingly.

[0205]
This is much easier

[0206]
Than trying to memorize hundreds of patterns.

[0207]
We just read the story.

[0208]
We understand the flow.

[0209]
We know who's winning.

[0210]
And we go with the winner.

[0211]
Simple as that.

[0212]
Now let's look at some real examples.

[0213]
I'll show you how to apply this.

[0214]
Look at this chart.

[0215]
What do you see?

[0216]
First, what's the big picture?

[0217]
What's the trend?

[0218]
Is it going up?

[0219]
Going down?

[0220]
Or sideways?

[0221]
Once we know that

[0222]
Then we look at the candles.

[0223]
Which ones are the major candles?

[0224]
Where are they located?

[0225]
Are they at key levels?

[0226]
If yes, those are important scenes.

[0227]
Pay attention to those.

[0228]
See what happens there.

[0229]
Do the bulls break through?

[0230]
Or do the bears hold?

[0231]
Whatever happens

[0232]
We trade with the winner.

[0233]
Don't fight it.

[0234]
Don't try to be a hero.

[0235]
Just follow the story.

[0236]
Now here's an interesting part.

[0237]
Sometimes the story changes.

[0238]
The plot twists.

[0239]
The hero becomes the villain.

[0240]
Or the villain becomes the hero.

[0241]
How do we know when this happens?

[0242]
We watch for key changes.

[0243]
Major candles appearing at key levels.

[0244]
Trend reversals.

[0245]
When an uptrend can't make new highs anymore.

[0246]
Or a downtrend can't make new lows.

[0247]
That's when the plot might be changing.

[0248]
The story might be turning.

[0249]
We need to be ready.

[0250]
Maybe the other side is taking over.

[0251]
Now we know the plot, right?

[0252]
We understand the story structure.

[0253]
So we can anticipate what might happen next.

[0254]
But we don't guess.

[0255]
We wait for confirmation.

[0256]
We wait for the chart to show us.

[0257]
Then we act.

[0258]
This is the safe way to trade.

[0259]
Follow the evidence.

[0260]
Not our emotions.

[0261]
Not our predictions.

[0262]
Just what the chart is telling us.

[0263]
What the story is showing us.

[0264]
Now let's talk about momentum.

[0265]
Momentum is like the energy of the story.

[0266]
When a scene has lots of action

[0267]
Lots of drama

[0268]
That's high momentum.

[0269]
Big candles, strong moves.

[0270]
Price moving fast in one direction.

[0271]
When you see this

[0272]
That side has the power.

[0273]
They're dominating.

[0274]
But when the action slows down

[0275]
Small candles, sideways movement

[0276]
That's low momentum.

[0277]
Neither side has clear control.

[0278]
This is when we need to be careful.

[0279]
Don't force a trade.

[0280]
Wait for the story to pick up again.

[0281]
Wait for one side to take control.

[0282]
Then we trade with them.

[0283]
This is how professionals trade.

[0284]
They don't trade all the time.

[0285]
They wait for the right moments.

[0286]
The right scenes.

[0287]
When the story is clear.

[0288]
When one side is dominating.

[0289]
That's when they enter.

[0290]
And they go with the dominant side.

[0291]
Never against it.

[0292]
This is the key principle.

[0293]
Follow the strength.

[0294]
Trade with the flow.

[0295]
Don't fight the market.

[0296]
The market is always right.

[0297]
Our job is to adapt.

[0298]
To go with what's happening.

[0299]
Not to predict what will happen.

[0300]
But to react to what is happening.

[0301]
Now let's look at a real chart example.

[0302]
This is a live chart.

[0303]
Look at the overall trend first.

[0304]
What do you see?

[0305]
Price is making higher highs and higher lows.

[0306]
This is an uptrend.

[0307]
The bulls are in control.

[0308]
This is the big picture.

[0309]
Now let's zoom in.

[0310]
Look at this level here.

[0311]
This is a key resistance level.

[0312]
Price tested it multiple times.

[0313]
See these candles?

[0314]
These are major candles.

[0315]
Big red candles defending this level.

[0316]
The bears are putting up a fight.

[0317]
They don't want price to break through.

[0318]
But look what happens.

[0319]
Price keeps coming back.

[0320]
The bulls keep trying.

[0321]
Each time they try

[0322]
They get rejected.

[0323]
But each rejection is weaker.

[0324]
The bears are losing strength.

[0325]
See how the red candles are getting smaller?

[0326]
This tells us something.

[0327]
The bears can't defend forever.

[0328]
They're running out of steam.

[0329]
And then look.

[0330]
Here comes a big green candle.

[0331]
This is a major candle on the bull side.

[0332]
It breaks through the resistance.

[0333]
The bulls have won this battle.

[0334]
The plot has shifted.

[0335]
Now the bulls are dominating even more.

[0336]
What do we do?

[0337]
We go with the bulls.

[0338]
We don't fight them.

[0339]
We trade in their direction.

[0340]
This is how you read the story.

[0341]
You see the battle.

[0342]
You see who's winning.

[0343]
You see when the plot shifts.

[0344]
Then you trade accordingly.

[0345]
Now let's look at another example.

[0346]
This time a downtrend.

[0347]
Price making lower lows and lower highs.

[0348]
The bears are in control.

[0349]
Look at this support level.

[0350]
Price keeps testing it.

[0351]
The bulls try to defend.

[0352]
But the bears keep pushing down.

[0353]
Look at these big red candles.

[0354]
Major candles on the bear side.

[0355]
They're dominating.

[0356]
Each time price tries to bounce

[0357]
The bears push it back down.

[0358]
This tells us the bears are strong.

[0359]
They're in control.

[0360]
So what do we do?

[0361]
We trade with the bears.

[0362]
We go short.

[0363]
We don't try to pick a bottom.

[0364]
We don't try to be heroes.

[0365]
We just follow the story.

[0366]
The bears are dominating, we go with them.

[0367]
Until the story changes.

[0368]
Until we see signs of reversal.

[0369]
Then we'll adjust.

[0370]
But for now, we follow the bears.

[0371]
This is the key to successful trading.

[0372]
Reading the story.

[0373]
Understanding who's in control.

[0374]
Then trading with them.

[0375]
Not against them.

[0376]
Now let's talk about key scenes.

[0377]
Important levels in the chart.

[0378]
These are like critical scenes in a movie.

[0379]
Where the main action happens.

[0380]
Where the battle takes place.

[0381]
How do we identify these key scenes?

[0382]
Look for previous highs and lows.

[0383]
Look for levels where price reacted strongly before.

[0384]
These become support and resistance.

[0385]
When price comes back to these levels

[0386]
That's a key scene.

[0387]
That's where we pay attention.

[0388]
Watch what the major candles do there.

[0389]
Do they break through?

[0390]
Or do they bounce back?

[0391]
This tells us what happens next.

[0392]
If they break through, the trend continues.

[0393]
If they bounce back, we might see a reversal.

[0394]
These key scenes are where the story turns.

[0395]
Where the plot shifts.

[0396]
So we need to watch them carefully.

[0397]
Don't just trade randomly.

[0398]
Wait for these key scenes.

[0399]
Wait for the important moments.

[0400]
Then make your move.

[0401]
Now let's talk about patterns.

[0402]
You might know some common patterns.

[0403]
Head and shoulders, triangles, flags.

[0404]
These are all good.

[0405]
But when you understand the story

[0406]
You don't need to memorize them.

[0407]
Because you understand why they work.

[0408]
A head and shoulders pattern - what is it really?

[0409]
It's showing us a shift in the story.

[0410]
The bulls were in control.

[0411]
They made a high - the left shoulder.

[0412]
Then an even higher high - the head.

[0413]
But then they can't go higher.

[0414]
They only make it to the same level as before - right shoulder.

[0415]
This tells us the bulls are losing strength.

[0416]
The story might be changing.

[0417]
When the neckline breaks

[0418]
That confirms it - the bears have taken over.

[0419]
See? We don't need to memorize.

[0420]
We just understand the story.

[0421]
Same with triangles.

[0422]
What's really happening?

[0423]
Bulls and bears are evenly matched.

[0424]
Price is consolidating.

[0425]
Getting tighter and tighter.

[0426]
Building energy.

[0427]
Then eventually one side wins.

[0428]
Price breaks out.

[0429]
That's just the story playing out.

[0430]
Once you see it this way

[0431]
Charts become so much easier.

[0432]
You're not memorizing patterns.

[0433]
You're reading a story.

[0434]
You're watching a movie.

[0435]
Much more interesting, right?

[0436]
And more effective too.

[0437]
Because you understand the why.

[0438]
Not just the what.

[0439]
Now let's look at timeframes.

[0440]
Different timeframes tell different parts of the story.

[0441]
The higher timeframe is the main plot.

[0442]
The bigger picture.

[0443]
The lower timeframes are the details.

[0444]
The scene-by-scene action.

[0445]
You need to understand both.

[0446]
Always check the higher timeframe first.

[0447]
What's the main story?

[0448]
Which way is it going?

[0449]
Then zoom into lower timeframes.

[0450]
To find your entry and exit.

[0451]
But don't trade against the main story.

[0452]
If the daily chart shows uptrend

[0453]
Don't go short on the 5-minute chart.

[0454]
You're fighting the main plot.

[0455]
Trade with the main story.

[0456]
Use lower timeframes to fine-tune your entries.

[0457]
Not to trade against the trend.

[0458]
This is a common mistake.

[0459]
People see a setup on lower timeframe

[0460]
But it's against the higher timeframe trend.

[0461]
They take the trade and lose.

[0462]
Because they're fighting the main story.

[0463]
Always align with the bigger picture.

[0464]
Now let's talk about momentum again.

[0465]
Momentum is important.

[0466]
It tells us how strong the move is.

[0467]
High momentum - big candles, fast moves.

[0468]
This means that side is dominating.

[0469]
Low momentum - small candles, slow moves.

[0470]
Neither side is in control.

[0471]
When momentum is high

[0472]
That's when we want to trade.

[0473]
Because the story is clear.

[0474]
One side is winning.

[0475]
When momentum is low

[0476]
Be careful.

[0477]
The story isn't clear yet.

[0478]
Wait for it to pick up.

[0479]
Wait for one side to take control.

[0480]
Then trade with them.

[0481]
This is how you avoid getting chopped.

[0482]
Don't trade in low momentum periods.

[0483]
Wait for the story to develop.

[0484]
Wait for clear direction.

[0485]
Then make your move.

[0486]
This will save you so much money.

[0487]
And make you so much more.

[0488]
Because you're trading with clarity.

[0489]
With understanding.

[0490]
Not just guessing.

[0491]
Now let's look at this chart here.

[0492]
See this consolidation?

[0493]
Small candles, low momentum.

[0494]
Bulls and bears are evenly matched.

[0495]
The story is paused.

[0496]
We don't know who will win yet.

[0497]
So what do we do?

[0498]
We wait.

[0499]
We don't force it.

[0500]
We let the story develop.

[0501]
And then see which side wins.

[0502]
See, like this - it's a pin bar right here.

[0503]
If we combine these two candles together

[0504]
It becomes a candle like this. This candle formed at resistance.

[0505]
At resistance, it has more significance than forming elsewhere. If it appeared in the middle somewhere, it wouldn't mean much.

[0506]
But it's at resistance - meaning it's at their fortress, at their stronghold.

[0507]
They're counterattacking. They have the strength to fight back. So that's why it continues down like this.

[0508]
See? And then momentum comes back and it goes down. It couldn't go deeper than before, couldn't make a lower low yet.

[0509]
When it came down, it's stuck right at support, at support.

[0510]
It's stuck right at the support level. The battle continues like this, see?

[0511]
Then when it goes up, and when it drops

[0512]
When it drops, it bounces back up. See? Drops then bounces up.

[0513]
Then it goes up. See? The plot, see?

[0514]
Who's in control here?

[0515]
The buy side is in control, the bulls.

[0516]
So we trade with the bulls.

[0517]
We go long.

[0518]
Until something changes.

[0519]
Until we see the bears taking over.

[0520]
But for now, bulls are dominating.

[0521]
So we stay with them.

[0522]
This is the core principle.

[0523]
Follow the dominant side.

[0524]
Don't fight them.

[0525]
Now I'll show you something interesting.

[0526]
When price is at a key level

[0527]
And you see these patterns forming

[0528]
Pin bar, engulfing, whatever

[0529]
What are they really telling you?

[0530]
They're telling you about the battle.

[0531]
Who's winning, who's losing.

[0532]
A pin bar at resistance - what does it mean?

[0533]
Bulls tried to break through.

[0534]
Bears pushed them back hard.

[0535]
Long wick up, close near the low.

[0536]
That's the bears saying 'not today'.

[0537]
They're defending their territory.

[0538]
Same thing at support.

[0539]
Pin bar with long wick down

[0540]
Bulls saying 'nope, not breaking down'.

[0541]
They're defending.

[0542]
Engulfing pattern - what is it?

[0543]
One side completely dominates the other.

[0544]
Bullish engulfing - bulls take over.

[0545]
Bearish engulfing - bears take control.

[0546]
See? It's all about the story.

[0547]
About the battle.

[0548]
Once you understand this

[0549]
Patterns make so much more sense.

[0550]
You're not just memorizing shapes.

[0551]
You're understanding what's happening.

[0552]
Why the pattern formed.

[0553]
What it means for price action.

[0554]
This makes you a much better trader.

[0555]
Now let's look at volume.

[0556]
Volume is like the intensity of the scene.

[0557]
High volume means lots of action.

[0558]
Lots of participants.

[0559]
Strong emotions.

[0560]
Low volume means not much interest.

[0561]
Weak commitment.

[0562]
When you see a breakout with high volume

[0563]
That's a powerful scene.

[0564]
Lots of energy.

[0565]
The move is likely to continue.

[0566]
But a breakout with low volume

[0567]
Suspicious.

[0568]
Not much conviction.

[0569]
Might be a fake breakout.

[0570]
Price might reverse.

[0571]
So we watch volume too.

[0572]
It adds to the story.

[0573]
Tells us how committed each side is.

[0574]
How much strength they have.

[0575]
Now let's put it all together.

[0576]
Reading charts like reading a story.

[0577]
Step 1: Look at the big picture.

[0578]
What's the trend?

[0579]
Which side is dominating?

[0580]
Step 2: Identify key levels.

[0581]
Where are the important scenes?

[0582]
Support, resistance, previous highs and lows.

[0583]
Step 3: Look at the characters.

[0584]
Which candles are major candles?

[0585]
Where are they located?

[0586]
Step 4: Watch the battle.

[0587]
What's happening at key levels?

[0588]
Who's winning?

[0589]
Step 5: Check momentum.

[0590]
Is there strong movement?

[0591]
Or is it consolidating?

[0592]
Step 6: Consider volume.

[0593]
Is there conviction?

[0594]
Or is it weak?

[0595]
Step 7: Make your decision.

[0596]
Trade with the dominant side.

[0597]
At the right time.

[0598]
At key levels.

[0599]
With confirmation.

[0600]
This is how professionals do it.

[0601]
They don't guess.

[0602]
They read the story.

[0603]
They understand what's happening.

[0604]
Then they act.

[0605]
With the flow.

[0606]
Not against it.

[0607]
Now I'll show you some real examples.

[0608]
So you can see this in action.

[0609]
Look at this chart here.

[0610]
First, what's the trend?

[0611]
Clearly uptrend.

[0612]
Higher highs, higher lows.

[0613]
Bulls are in control.

[0614]
Now where are the key levels?

[0615]
Here's a previous resistance.

[0616]
Price broke through it.

[0617]
Now it should become support.

[0618]
Let's see if it does.

[0619]
Price comes back down.

[0620]
Tests this level.

[0621]
What happens?

[0622]
See these candles?

[0623]
Green candles defending.

[0624]
Bulls saying 'nope, not breaking down'.

[0625]
Price bounces back up.

[0626]
The level held.

[0627]
Bulls are still in control.

[0628]
What do we do?

[0629]
We buy here.

[0630]
We go with the bulls.

[0631]
We trade at this key level.

[0632]
Where we have confirmation.

[0633]
See how clean that is?

[0634]
We're not guessing.

[0635]
We're reading the story.

[0636]
The story told us bulls are in control.

[0637]
The level held.

[0638]
So we go long.

[0639]
Simple.

[0640]
Now look at another example.

[0641]
This time a downtrend.

[0642]
Lower lows, lower highs.

[0643]
Bears dominating.

[0644]
Previous support becomes resistance.

[0645]
Price comes back up to test it.

[0646]
What happens?

[0647]
Red candles defending.

[0648]
Bears saying 'not breaking up'.

[0649]
Price gets rejected.

[0650]
Goes back down.

[0651]
So we short here.

[0652]
We go with the bears.

[0653]
Again, simple.

[0654]
Read the story.

[0655]
Trade accordingly.

[0656]
This is what I want you to understand.

[0657]
Trading doesn't have to be complicated.

[0658]
You don't need 50 indicators.

[0659]
You don't need complex algorithms.

[0660]
You just need to read the story.

[0661]
Understand what's happening.

[0662]
See who's in control.

[0663]
Then trade with them.

[0664]
That's it.

[0665]
Everything else is just details.

[0666]
Now, some of you might be thinking

[0667]
'But what about fundamentals?'

[0668]
'What about news?'

[0669]
'What about economic data?'

[0670]
Here's the thing.

[0671]
All of that is already in the chart.

[0672]
The chart is the ultimate truth.

[0673]
It shows what everyone thinks.

[0674]
What everyone's doing.

[0675]
All the news, all the data

[0676]
It's all reflected in price.

[0677]
So we don't need to know the news.

[0678]
We just need to read what the price is telling us.

[0679]
The chart never lies.

[0680]
It shows us exactly what's happening.

[0681]
Who's buying, who's selling.

[0682]
Who's winning, who's losing.

[0683]
That's all we need to know.

[0684]
Now let's talk about risk management.

[0685]
This is crucial.

[0686]
You can read the story perfectly

[0687]
But if you don't manage risk

[0688]
You'll still lose.

[0689]
So here's how we do it.

[0690]
When we enter a trade

[0691]
We always use a stop loss.

[0692]
Always.

[0693]
No exceptions.

[0694]
Where do we put it?

[0695]
At a logical level.

[0696]
If we're buying at support

[0697]
Stop goes below support.

[0698]
If we're selling at resistance

[0699]
Stop goes above resistance.

[0700]
Why?

[0701]
Because if our story is wrong

[0702]
If the level breaks

[0703]
We get out immediately.

[0704]
We don't hope it comes back.

[0705]
We don't average down.

[0706]
We just exit.

[0707]
Accept we were wrong.

[0708]
And move on.

[0709]
This keeps our losses small.

[0710]
And our account safe.

[0711]
Now for profit targets.

[0712]
Where do we take profit?

[0713]
At the next logical level.

[0714]
If we're buying at support

[0715]
We take profit at resistance.

[0716]
If we're selling at resistance

[0717]
We take profit at support.

[0718]
Or we trail our stop.

[0719]
Let the winners run.

[0720]
As long as the story continues.

[0721]
As long as our side is dominating.

[0722]
We stay in.

[0723]
But when signs change

[0724]
When the story shifts

[0725]
We exit.

[0726]
This is how we maximize profits.

[0727]
We let good trades run.

[0728]
And cut bad trades quickly.

[0729]
Simple risk management.

[0730]
But incredibly effective.

[0731]
Now let's talk about psychology.

[0732]
This is where most traders fail.

[0733]
Not because they can't read charts.

[0734]
But because they can't control emotions.

[0735]
Fear and greed.

[0736]
These kill traders.

[0737]
Fear makes you exit too early.

[0738]
Greed makes you hold too long.

[0739]
How do we avoid this?

[0740]
By following the story.

[0741]
The story keeps us objective.

[0742]
We're not guessing.

[0743]
We're not hoping.

[0744]
We're just reading what's there.

[0745]
If the story says bulls are winning

[0746]
We trade with bulls.

[0747]
Regardless of how we feel.

[0748]
If the story says bears are winning

[0749]
We trade with bears.

[0750]
Our emotions don't matter.

[0751]
Only the story matters.

[0752]
This removes emotion.

[0753]
Makes trading mechanical.

[0754]
In a good way.

[0755]
We become like robots.

[0756]
Following a system.

[0757]
Not emotional.

[0758]
This is how you survive long-term.

[0759]
So remember.

[0760]
Read charts like reading a story.

[0761]
Look at the big picture first.

[0762]
Identify key levels.

[0763]
Watch the major candles.

[0764]
See who's winning.

[0765]
Trade with them.

[0766]
Manage your risk.

[0767]
Control your emotions.

[0768]
Follow the story.

[0769]
That's it.

[0770]
That's all you need.

[0771]
Now let me show you one more thing.

[0772]
Multiple timeframe analysis.

[0773]
This is powerful.

[0774]
We look at the daily chart first.

[0775]
What's the main story?

[0776]
Uptrend, downtrend, sideways?

[0777]
This is our guide.

[0778]
Then we zoom to 4-hour chart.

[0779]
Same question.

[0780]
What's happening here?

[0781]
Is it aligned with daily?

[0782]
If yes, strong confirmation.

[0783]
If no, we wait.

[0784]
Then 1-hour chart.

[0785]
For entry timing.

[0786]
We only trade when all timeframes agree.

[0787]
Daily uptrend.

[0788]
4-hour uptrend.

[0789]
1-hour shows pullback to support.

[0790]
We buy there.

[0791]
This gives us the highest probability.

[0792]
All timeframes telling the same story.

[0793]
All agreeing on direction.

[0794]
This is when we have confidence.

[0795]
This is when we go big.

[0796]
Not big like crazy.

[0797]
But with proper position sizing.

[0798]
We increase our risk slightly.

[0799]
Because probability is high.

[0800]
When timeframes don't align.

[0801]
We reduce position size.

[0802]
Or don't trade at all.

[0803]
We wait for alignment.

[0804]
Patience is key.

[0805]
Don't force trades.

[0806]
Wait for the right setup.

[0807]
The right story.

[0808]
Then execute.

[0809]
This discipline separates winners from losers.

[0810]
Winners wait for good setups.

[0811]
Losers trade everything.

[0812]
Winners are selective.

[0813]
Quality over quantity.

[0814]
A few good trades per week.

[0815]
Is better than many mediocre ones.

[0816]
Remember that.

[0817]
Now let me show you this chart.

[0818]
See this consolidation?

[0819]
Price going sideways.

[0820]
What's the story saying?

[0821]
Bulls and bears are evenly matched.

[0822]
Neither side can win yet.

[0823]
What do we do?

[0824]
We wait.

[0825]
We don't trade in the middle of consolidation.

[0826]
Too risky.

[0827]
No clear direction.

[0828]
We wait for the breakout.

[0829]
Wait for one side to win.

[0830]
Then we trade with them.

[0831]
See? Patience.

[0832]
Not every moment is tradeable.

[0833]
Sometimes the story is unclear.

[0834]
That's okay.

[0835]
We wait for clarity.

[0836]
Better to miss a trade

[0837]
Than to take a bad one.

[0838]
This mindset is crucial.

[0839]
It protects your capital.

[0840]
Keeps you in the game.

[0841]
So you can trade another day.

[0842]
Capital preservation is number one.

[0843]
Before making money

[0844]
Don't lose money.

[0845]
That's the rule.

[0846]
Now let's see another example.

[0847]
This is a perfect setup.

[0848]
Daily uptrend.

[0849]
4-hour uptrend.

[0850]
Price pulls back to support on 1-hour.

[0851]
See these candles?

[0852]
Major candles defending support.

[0853]
All timeframes aligned.

[0854]
Perfect setup.

[0855]
We buy here.

[0856]
Stop below support.

[0857]
Target at next resistance.

[0858]
This is a textbook trade.

[0859]
High probability.

[0860]
All conditions met.

[0861]
This is what we wait for.

[0862]
These setups don't come every day.

[0863]
Maybe a few times per week.

[0864]
But when they do

[0865]
They're golden.

[0866]
High win rate.

[0867]
Good risk-reward ratio.

[0868]
This is what professionals trade.

[0869]
Not random setups.

[0870]
But perfect stories.

[0871]
When everything lines up.

[0872]
When the message is clear.

[0873]
That's when we act.

[0874]
Now I want you to practice this.

[0875]
Go look at charts.

[0876]
Any chart, any pair.

[0877]
And read the story.

[0878]
Don't trade yet.

[0879]
Just read.

[0880]
What's the trend?

[0881]
Where are key levels?

[0882]
Who's dominating?

[0883]
What's happening at key scenes?

[0884]
Practice this.

[0885]
Every day.

[0886]
Until it becomes second nature.

[0887]
Until you can read charts

[0888]
Like you read books.

[0889]
Naturally.

[0890]
Without thinking.

[0891]
This takes time.

[0892]
Don't rush it.

[0893]
But keep practicing.

[0894]
And you'll get there.

[0895]
You'll see charts differently.

[0896]
Not as random candles.

[0897]
But as a story.

[0898]
A battle between bulls and bears.

[0899]
And you'll know who's winning.

[0900]
That's when trading becomes easy.

[0901]
Not complicated anymore.

[0902]
Just natural.

[0903]
Like breathing.

[0904]
That's the goal.

[0905]
Okay, so to summarize.

[0906]
Reading charts like reading a story.

[0907]
This is the key concept.

[0908]
Everything else flows from this.

[0909]
Understand the narrative.

[0910]
See the characters.

[0911]
Watch the plot unfold.

[0912]
Identify the key scenes.

[0913]
Know who's dominating.

[0914]
Trade with them.

[0915]
Manage your risk properly.

[0916]
Control your emotions.

[0917]
Be patient.

[0918]
Wait for the right setups.

[0919]
And execute when everything aligns.

[0920]
That's professional trading.

[0921]
That's how you survive long-term.

[0922]
That's how you make consistent profits.

[0923]
Not by guessing.

[0924]
Not by hoping.

[0925]
But by reading the story correctly.

[0926]
And acting on what you see.

[0927]
Not on what you want to see.

[0928]
But what's actually there.

[0929]
The truth in the chart.

[0930]
That's what matters.

[0931]
Now before we finish

[0932]
Let me show you a few more examples.

[0933]
Real trading examples.

[0934]
So you can see this method in action.

[0935]
Look at this chart.

[0936]
What do you see?

[0937]
Take a moment.

[0938]
Read the story.

[0939]
What's happening here?

[0940]
Think about it.

[0941]
Okay, let me tell you what I see.

[0942]
First, overall trend.

[0943]
Price making lower lows and lower highs.

[0944]
Downtrend.

[0945]
Bears in control.

[0946]
Now look at this level.

[0947]
Previous support, right?

[0948]
Price broke through it.

[0949]
Now comes back to test it.

[0950]
Should act as resistance now.

[0951]
Let's see what happens.

[0952]
Look, red candles.

[0953]
Bears defending this level.

[0954]
Price gets rejected.

[0955]
Can't break through.

[0956]
Goes back down.

[0957]
This confirms the downtrend.

[0958]
Bears still in control.

[0959]
What do we do?

[0960]
We short here.

[0961]
At this resistance.

[0962]
With stop above.

[0963]
Target at next support.

[0964]
Simple trade.

[0965]
Following the story.

[0966]
Trading with the bears.

[0967]
Not against them.

[0968]
See how logical that is?

[0969]
When you read the story

[0970]
Trading decisions become obvious.

[0971]
You're not confused.

[0972]
You know what to do.

[0973]
Because the chart tells you.

[0974]
Another example.

[0975]
This time uptrend.

[0976]
Higher highs, higher lows.

[0977]
Bulls dominating.

[0978]
Price pulls back to a previous high.

[0979]
Which should now be support.

[0980]
Let's see.

[0981]
Green candles appear.

[0982]
Bulls defending.

[0983]
Price bounces up.

[0984]
Support holds.

[0985]
Uptrend continues.

[0986]
We buy here.

[0987]
At this support.

[0988]
Stop below.

[0989]
Target at next resistance.

[0990]
Again, simple.

[0991]
Following the story.

[0992]
Trading with the bulls.

[0993]
See the pattern?

[0994]
It's always the same.

[0995]
Read the trend.

[0996]
Find key levels.

[0997]
Wait for price to come there.

[0998]
See who defends.

[0999]
Trade with them.

[1000]
That's the method.

[1001]
Now, is it really this easy?

[1002]
Yes and no.

[1003]
The concept is simple.

[1004]
But execution takes practice.

[1005]
You need to train your eyes.

[1006]
To see the story.

[1007]
To recognize the patterns.

[1008]
To understand what's happening.

[1009]
This doesn't happen overnight.

[1010]
It takes time.

[1011]
It takes screen time.

[1012]
Looking at charts every day.

[1013]
Practicing reading the story.

[1014]
But once you get it

[1015]
It's yours forever.

[1016]
It becomes intuitive.

[1017]
You'll see it instantly.

[1018]
No thinking required.

[1019]
Just like reading.

[1020]
You don't think about each word.

[1021]
You just read.

[1022]
Same with charts.

[1023]
You'll just see the story.

[1024]
Automatically.

[1025]
That's the goal.

[1026]
That's what we're aiming for.

[1027]
So keep practicing.

[1028]
Don't give up.

[1029]
Even if it's confusing at first.

[1030]
It will click.

[1031]
I promise.

[1032]
Now let's look at risk-reward ratio.

[1033]
This is important.

[1034]
Every trade should have good risk-reward.

[1035]
At least 1:2.

[1036]
Risk 1 to make 2.

[1037]
Or better.

[1038]
How do we calculate this?

[1039]
Entry to stop is our risk.

[1040]
Entry to target is our reward.

[1041]
If risk is 50 pips

[1042]
Reward should be 100 pips minimum.

[1043]
Or 1:2 ratio.

[1044]
This means even if we win only half our trades

[1045]
We still make money overall.

[1046]
This is crucial.

[1047]
Good risk-reward protects us.

[1048]
Allows us to lose and still profit.

[1049]
Never take trades with bad risk-reward.

[1050]
No matter how good the setup looks.

[1051]
If the risk-reward is bad

[1052]
Skip it.

[1053]
Wait for better opportunity.

[1054]
This discipline is key.

[1055]
Now let's talk about win rate.

[1056]
You don't need high win rate.

[1057]
50% is enough.

[1058]
With 1:2 risk-reward.

[1059]
You profit with 50% wins.

[1060]
Let me show you the math.

[1061]
10 trades, 5 wins, 5 losses.

[1062]
Each win makes 100, each loss costs 50.

[1063]
Total wins: 500.

[1064]
Total losses: 250.

[1065]
Net profit: 250.

[1066]
See?

[1067]
50% win rate is profitable.

[1068]
With good risk-reward.

[1069]
So don't stress about win rate.

[1070]
Focus on risk-reward instead.

[1071]
This changes everything.

[1072]
You don't need to be right all the time.

[1073]
Just need good risk-reward.

[1074]
And consistent execution.

[1075]
That's the secret.

[1076]
Professional traders know this.

[1077]
They lose all the time.

[1078]
But they still make money.

[1079]
Because of risk-reward.

[1080]
Remember that.

[1081]
It's not about being right.

[1082]
It's about risk management.

[1083]
Okay, we're almost at the end.

[1084]
Let me give you final thoughts.

[1085]
Trading is a journey.

[1086]
Not a destination.

[1087]
You never stop learning.

[1088]
Markets always changing.

[1089]
Always evolving.

[1090]
We need to adapt.

[1091]
But the principles stay the same.

[1092]
Reading the story.

[1093]
Understanding flow.

[1094]
Trading with dominant side.

[1095]
Managing risk properly.

[1096]
These never change.

[1097]
Master these principles.

[1098]
And you'll succeed.

[1099]
No matter what market.

[1100]
No matter what timeframe.

[1101]
These principles work everywhere.

[1102]
Forex, stocks, crypto.

[1103]
All the same.

[1104]
Because it's human psychology.

[1105]
Fear and greed.

[1106]
Bulls and bears.

[1107]
The story repeats.

[1108]
Just different names.

[1109]
Different timeframes.

[1110]
But same principles.

[1111]
So master this method.

[1112]
And you have a skill for life.

[1113]
A skill that makes money.

[1114]
Anywhere, anytime.

[1115]
That's powerful.

[1116]
That's freedom.

[1117]
Okay, I think we've covered everything.

[1118]
The main concepts.

[1119]
Reading charts like reading a story.

[1120]
Understanding the narrative.

[1121]
Seeing the characters.

[1122]
Following the plot.

[1123]
Trading with the dominant side.

[1124]
Managing risk.

[1125]
Controlling emotions.

[1126]
Being patient.

[1127]
Waiting for the right setups.

[1128]
These are the keys.

[1129]
Master these

[1130]
And you'll be a successful trader.

[1131]
I believe in you.

[1132]
You can do this.

[1133]
Just keep practicing.

[1134]
Keep learning.

[1135]
Keep improving.

[1136]
Never give up.

[1137]
Even when it's hard.

[1138]
Even when you lose.

[1139]
Keep going.

[1140]
Success is inevitable.

[1141]
If you persist.

[1142]
If you follow the principles.

[1143]
If you stay disciplined.

[1144]
You will succeed.

[1145]
I guarantee it.

[1146]
Okay, let's wrap up.

[1147]
Thank you for watching.

[1148]
Thank you for learning with me.

[1149]
I hope this helps you.

[1150]
On your trading journey.

[1151]
Remember to practice.

[1152]
Practice makes perfect.

[1153]
Look at charts every day.

[1154]
Read the story.

[1155]
Train your eyes.

[1156]
And you'll get better.

[1157]
I promise.

[1158]
Alright, that's it for today.

[1159]
I hope you learned something.

[1160]
Something valuable.

[1161]
That you can use.

[1162]
In your trading.

[1163]
To make better decisions.

[1164]
To make more money.

[1165]
And lose less.

[1166]
That's the goal.

[1167]
To be profitable.

[1168]
Consistently.

[1169]
Over the long term.

[1170]
That's what matters.

[1171]
Not one lucky trade.

[1172]
But consistent performance.

[1173]
Month after month.

[1174]
Year after year.

[1175]
That's professional trading.

[1176]
And you can achieve it.

[1177]
With this method.

[1178]
Reading charts like reading a story.

[1179]
It works.

[1180]
Trust me.

[1181]
I've been doing this for years.

[1182]
And it works.

[1183]
Every time.

[1184]
When you follow the principles.

[1185]
When you stay disciplined.

[1186]
When you manage risk properly.

[1187]
It works.

[1188]
So try it.

[1189]
Apply it.

[1190]
See for yourself.

[1191]
You'll be amazed.

[1192]
At how much clearer charts become.

[1193]
How much easier trading gets.

[1194]
When you understand the story.

[1195]
When you see what's really happening.

[1196]
Behind all those candles.

[1197]
The battle.

[1198]
Bulls versus bears.

[1199]
And you'll know who's winning.

[1201]
That's when you trade with confidence.

[1202]
When you know the story.

[1203]
When you understand what's happening.

[1204]
No more guessing.

[1205]
No more hoping.

[1206]
Just reading and acting.

[1207]
Simple.

[1208]
Effective.

[1209]
Profitable.

[1210]
That's the goal.

[1211]
Okay, let's continue with more examples.

[1212]
So you really understand this method.

[1213]
Look at this chart.

[1214]
Price is in a range.

[1215]
Going sideways.

[1295]
Alright, we're getting close to the end.

[1296]
Just a few more things to cover.

[1297]
Some final tips.

[1298]
And we'll be done.

[1299]
Stay with me.

[1300]
Almost there.

[1301]
Still not very impressive.

[1302]
But going against it would be more concerning.

[1303]
With this candle here.

[1304]
It still seems to have opposing momentum.

[1305]
So it's rising, but the upward momentum is decreasing. True, it has to hit this major candle at this level.

[1306]
If it breaks through here, the momentum will still be there to push it higher.

[1307]
Let's see if it can make it.

[1308]
Ah, here it comes. Starting to show some strength. See that? Red's trying to push down.

[1309]
Pushing down, but in the end it rises and closes as a decent-sized candle.

[1310]
So there's strength here. The major candle's broken now.

[1311]
I'm switching this slightly. I'm moving it to this tail.

[1312]
See? It'll battle around this tail now. Here, they're trying.

[1313]
Will they break the tail?

[1314]
Turns out yes. Strong momentum coming in. So this zone's been reclaimed.

[1315]
Remove it. It's reclaimed. How much has been reclaimed?

[1316]
Then it runs out of steam up top. See that?

[1317]
Losing momentum at the top. Will it pull back down?

[1318]
Might not remove it yet. I'll keep it for now. Forgot that it needs to be resistance.

[1319]
If resistance is broken, it becomes support. Does it need to come back down to test support?

[1320]
So it comes to test, gets pushed back to its own base. Or do the soldiers after advancing return to get their supplies?

[1321]
It's come back to test support now. Let's say from resistance it becomes support.

[1322]
Yeah. It's pulled back around here. Far away.

[1323]
But looking at it, there's not much strength left with these two tails. This can be a swing. I'll mark it like this.

[1324]
It's not there yet, but after pulling back just this much and then surging up this high, it's definitely gone higher.

[1325]
Another trick for reading is when price rises like this, it's relatively stable and can go far for longer.

[1326]
But price that rises like this—this one's steep too. The steepness just suddenly shoots up like this.

[1327]
When it drops, it'll drop with force too. Like when we drive a car slowly climbing a hill using low gear, going up steadily.

[1328]
Almost at the top, then suddenly it's a steep incline and we floor the accelerator. Boom, shoots up.

[1329]
Until the engine's maxed out. Then as soon as you release the accelerator just a bit.

[1330]
The car rolls back. Because it's so steep.

[1331]
Instead of going gradually step by step, it would go further and longer.

[1332]
But if it rises like this, be careful.

[1333]
When it's like this. Rising like this.

[1334]
So be warned, then it drops with force like this.

[1335]
Dropping to here. To...

[1336]
Right before where it rose up sharply.

[1337]
So at this point we need to be careful.

[1338]
It's a support level. Be careful.

[1339]
Right.

[1340]
Now.

[1341]
With our tips and techniques.

[1342]
Others would say here.

[1343]
Is support.

[1344]
Support level.

[1345]
When it bounces. Let me remove this one.

[1346]
Or keep it for now.

[1347]
Let's see if it'll be useful in the future.

[1348]
We can keep adjusting these according to the current situation.

[1349]
Like suppose here it breaks through.

[1350]
Don't have to remove it, because we need to project the size from this line.

[1351]
Because here I've got a new swing.

[1352]
Taking its new high. This high. Project it forward. Let's see what happens next.

[1353]
Now we still see it's holding the tail of this one.

[1354]
But it's rising to make a swing. It can't just go up alone.

[1355]
It has to pull back to create a Higher Low as a Swing Low too.

[1356]
Around where, I don't know. We'll wait.

[1357]
Because looking here, it's rising but starting to struggle. See? Starting to battle, trying to rise then hitting these two tails.

[1358]
Here. Here. It's dropping now. Push it down. So we need to watch carefully because this is a weakening zone.

[1359]
Remember the wave concept we studied? About wave sizes.

[1360]
Pairing them up. This one goes down. This one goes up. This one's very long.

[1361]
This one goes up, short. Goes down, then up again. But only rises this much.

[1362]
Even shorter than before. Look, look, look, look. When rising...

[1363]
The upward momentum's fading. The bullish conviction is weakening.

[1364]
If we look at the momentum of the candlesticks.

[1365]
This candle's big. This one starts... Here there are only small candles lined up.

[1366]
And at this resistance level here there's a battle shown by tails.

[1367]
This is looking at candlesticks.

[1368]
Looking at the CD-DAL or our structure.

[1369]
It rises up, of course it needs some lows. But the chart can't keep rising forever.

[1370]
It has to consolidate. If it's going to continue, it needs to gather strength too.

[1371]
Or if we think from the perspective of this side, the red army here, they're defending already.

[1372]
Their army's being defeated. The major candle's already broken. An army this big is already dead.

[1373]
They have to send in new troops to take back territory, to reclaim their land.

[1374]
So according to our trick, where should the green side's level be?

[1375]
Here. It rests right here. The base isn't here. It's at the tip of this tail.

[1376]
Ah, let's keep watching to see what happens next.

[1377]
This level, I think if it rises it can, but there are two possibilities.

[1378]
But if it were me, I wouldn't trade yet.

[1379]
I'd wait and watch the situation here. This scene's important right now.

[1380]
Since it's losing momentum, it might pull back.

[1381]
If we look at it as a pattern, it could be a Double Top.

[1382]
Two of them here.

[1383]
See? Is it dropping with force? It's dropping now.

[1384]
From barely dropping bit by bit, now this candle drops.

[1385]
Boom. Completely wiped out the soldiers here.

[1386]
The upper side, the red side, they're starting to send reinforcements. They're coming down to take back territory.

[1387]
Let's see if they'll break this first fort. This one. It's broken. They'll want this candle.

[1388]
This candle's gone. Broken. Remove it. Only this left. Coming down here.

[1389]
There's this line too. Forgot about it.

[1390]
This swing.

[1391]
See? It's touching the swing here.

[1392]
Watch the symptoms. Watch closely.

[1393]
But looking at the symptoms, will it bounce?

[1394]
Coming into support with this much force, will this fort hold?

[1395]
Eh, just the top of this fort.

[1396]
It might advance all the way to this base here. This candle's evenly matched.

[1397]
See? Broken through. Broken through, remove it.

[1398]
Tested twice. Remove it, not important.

[1399]
Coming to here now. Here, here. The key scene's here. The original trendline's here.

[1400]
And the major candle's right here. Will it reach?


[1401]
It reaches perfectly. See? But does it hold? No it doesn't. See?

[1402]
Fights back up. This is a critical point like this.

[1403]
We need to watch if the next candle confirms this counterattack.

[1404]
Still green. There's still momentum going out.

[1405]
I'm not removing this line yet.

[1406]
It's bounced and showing signs. Let's keep this scene.

[1407]
This scene's still useful, let's keep it.

[1408]
Watch the strength. A major candle's resting here too.

[1409]
Hitting the major candle. Leaving the major candle behind.

[1410]
See? The major candle's resting here. It's acting as resistance perfectly.

[1411]
Like this, let's keep it as a key point. If the green candles want to go up again, they have to break through here.

[1412]
And if we look at our structure, is it still Higher High or Higher Low?

[1413]
Well? This Low's here. This Low hasn't gone lower than this Low yet. See?

[1414]
Still rising. High's still rising too. So

[1415]
We can expect it to make a higher High than this.

[1416]
We trade following the story. Following the plot. Following the series. Following the plot line like this.

[1417]
It's favoring the hero side, the green bulls side, so we follow along.

[1418]
Even though we see red dropping this much. Whoa, dropping this much. Wait, dropping here now.

[1419]
It could happen. It could drop. But since the story structure is like this.

[1420]
That is, after fighting back up, let's keep watching. Ah, dropping. But when it drops to touch here.

[1421]
There's no strength at all. See? Here fighting back. This candle, they haven't... The major candle.

[1422]
Here hasn't died yet. Still alive. Still there.

[1423]
Ah, see? Trying to push back up. But pushing like this, well, it's not

[1424]
That pretty yet. Still doesn't look very strong.

[1425]
The level's rising step by step, step by step. But see how it keeps rising steadily?

[1426]
And it keeps hugging the trendline all along. I haven't removed it yet.

[1427]
That I drew from the very beginning. Okay, here it might break through and that's true.

[1428]
But it's a sloppy break, and it gets pulled back. Pulled back. Pulled back. Pulled back.

[1429]
Until this candle. Here. Explodes. So basically, it's still an important level. Huh. Stitched.

[1430]
This border. Still useful. Still has soldiers. Let's say.

[1431]
Ah, we're starting to see green's strength coming now. See

[1432]
It? Starting to be large candles. From before, here they were small, small.

[1433]
This one's going to fight back the major candle here. Will it reach?

[1434]
They're trying to battle. We'll keep watching until we see something clear.

[1435]
But according to the story structure, it already says to hold the tail. Hold the hero's tail.

[1436]
So instead of guessing red will come down here, I'd guess we'll get a green candle going above here.

[1437]
Because according to the plan, this novel's come this far already.

[1438]
It'll get a high that's higher than this. According to the structure, it says so. It's an uptrend structure.

[1439]
Here it comes. Trying to go up and eat it. But that candle's no ordinary one either.

[1440]
It fights back up. Boom.

[1441]
Momentum closes going up with force. But if the next candle breaks through, we're okay.

[1442]
Ultimately it's still hugging the scene line. But this border still has soldiers that can fight.

[1443]
It pushes back up. The next candle can still, still, still survive.

[1444]
It can survive, hasn't died yet. It's guessing...

[1445]
See? Boom, momentum changes instantly.

[1446]
From small ones, like soldiers on this side, then rising Low by Low, never lower than this trendline. See?

[1447]
For green, for the hero side. They're holding the tail.

[1448]
They've been supporting all along. There's a force of soldiers backing continuously.

[1449]
Never retreating lower than before, just gradually being pushed back into their own territory.

[1450]
They send large candles to attack. Send the candles to attack.

[1451]
But haven't reached the bedroom yet. Let's keep watching.

[1452]
See? Can still fight. Haven't closed yet.

[1453]
Shot up then came down.

[1454]
And the next candle. Green's really trying hard to kill it.

[1455]
This side won't give up. Here they're battling at full strength too.

[1456]
This is a strong momentum candle. Pushing this hard.

[1457]
Huh, will it drop? Let's see again. Alright, the next candle, the next candle doesn't drop.

[1458]
It turns out to be a candle like this. Like every time it could fight before. The first two times it could fight.

[1459]
The third time, rises to here, then only pushes back this much.

[1460]
And closed above here. It's dead. All done. Remove it.

[1461]
The major candle here is gone. The next zone's left.

[1462]
That we have to watch next. See? The story continues. Like this.

[1463]
When the major candle's dead, what's left is just the next level to push through. Like this.

[1464]
Coming here, this probably reached a top already.

[1465]
Going up to the zone, bouncing, then dropping with this much force. Shows that, like this, they're strong too.

[1466]
The fort they're at around here is strong. So here coming up, after accumulating strength. Then retreating and coming up.

[1467]
And here starting to lose strength. Need to watch the next candle.

[1468]
If it's a green break through fine. But if it starts going to small candles starting to weaken.

[1469]
There's a chance it'll consolidate first. Why do we call it consolidate? Why don't I view it as dropping completely?

[1470]
Because as I said, we look at the story structure.

[1471]
The script's supporting this side. It's waiting for higher High.

[1472]
Waiting for a High higher than this one. Higher than this means, it has to be above this line, so it has to pass through anyway.

[1473]
Yeah. But it has to consolidate down first. To gather strength. To get supplies and food.

[1474]
To add energy for the soldiers to keep pushing forward. Let's see if I'm right. Oh.

[1475]
See? And it pulls back. But will it pull back just this much?

[1476]
I don't know. We'll keep watching.

[1477]
Keeps coming down. Like this, see?

[1478]
There's another trick to watch here for a moment.

[1479]
See here? It's like a reversal candlestick. See?

[1480]
It goes up then reverses at resistance.

[1481]
Here's the trendline. But it doesn't drop. It pushes through. So when price retraces back like this.

[1482]
It'll come back to find here. The one it was supposed to drop from.

[1483]
Don't know the reason. But notice it's like this. This is an extra trick for you.

[1484]
See? When I draw it, it hits here. Hits here. Hits here. Here it is. So this level's okay, keep it.

[1485]
Bounces. Remove this. Will it come kill this one or what? Remove it and let's wait here instead.

[1486]
See here, the key scene's here. Will it reach the key scene? Will it reach the key scene?

[1487]
Trying. Oscillating here. Yeah. Swinging.

[1488]
Swing, swing together. Battling here. There's like, to bring it here.

[1489]
But can't make it. Now breaks up. If it's this case, I think

[1490]
Red probably can't fight anymore. Next one should survive. See that it's rising.

[1491]
Yeah. Not coming down again. Coming down, down, but small drops. This one's eaten going up.

[1492]
Whoa, so long. Don't need to mention.

[1493]
Higher High for sure.

[1494]
This one.

[1495]
Finished printing. See? Broke through this line up to make a Higher High.

[1496]
Oh, forgot to mark.

[1497]
Pulled back just this much, so Higher Low too.

[1498]
See how the script, the script comes like this. You trade following the script.

[1499]
At first I thought this was big already.

[1500]
This one's big. Big candle. Big candle.


[1501]
This candle's bigger.

[1502]
So it can continue.

[1503]
Do you believe it? Huh, looking from this angle it's low so it can continue.

[1504]
Breaks through. Still continuing for real.

[1505]
Okay, see that? Here, here.

[1506]
At key scenes there'll be signs.

[1507]
Because when we're at a key scene, there are still signs at resistance.

[1508]
Oh, where'd it go?

[1509]
Let me remove this one first.

[1510]
Ah, it's right here.

[1511]
Okay.

[1512]
Here.

[1513]
Is it like this?

[1514]
Projected it here already.

[1515]
Still far.

[1516]
Has to go higher than this.

[1517]
Ah, okay, here.

[1518]
There. And there are signs.

[1519]
Because it's hitting resistance.

[1520]
Broken through already.

[1521]
We can say this army's taken it.

[1522]
So all the forts around here.

[1523]
All the borders around here.

[1524]
Green has reclaimed.

[1525]
From resistance it'll become support.

[1526]
Because this area's been claimed as theirs already.

[1527]
Will it come back to test?

[1528]
Just keeps going.

[1529]
Shows this stick's very strong.

[1530]
Has momentum to continue.

[1531]
But here if we look.

[1532]
If we look, wait. Keeps going. Hmm, I'm starting to watch.

[1533]
Well.

[1534]
If... who's holding.

[1535]
If you're holding a Buy order, you might TP and just sit and watch the situation.

[1536]
Why?

[1537]
Here! It rose straight up like this.

[1538]
And then struggled, struggled, struggled.

[1539]
See how it's losing momentum in pushing up already? It's

[1540]
Battling intensely around here. The force is equal. Just watch, just watch.

[1541]
But the tails keep getting shorter and shorter. Shorter.

[1542]
Come all the way here, the highest peak. Then goes up even more.

[1543]
Goes up again. Ah, ah, notice this. Notice carefully.

[1544]
That when it rises, it's lifting, breaking the trendline again.

[1545]
Reading it this way is a swing point, but if it breaks the swing, it breaks this line. If it breaks this line, it'll come to the next line which is this one.

[1546]
Running smoothly on top.

[1547]
Had it before, holding green's tail, right? This one.

[1548]
Holding green's tail. Momentum's starting to weaken, can't push higher.

[1549]
Seems like there's not much strength. Even though it can make a new High.

[1550]
Low's still rising. Chasing up.

[1551]
Chasing up like this. We follow the situation continuously.

[1552]
Keep watching. Can still go. If it goes well, follow it.

[1553]
Follow it along.

[1554]
Yeah, that's it. When we see this, that's it.

[1555]
Low, low, low. Which Low? This Low.

[1556]
This Low.

[1557]
Hasn't reached here yet. They're going to kill this army. The major candle's lying here. They're trying already. Will it survive? Hard to survive. With a candle this big. This is already big.

[1558]
This one's even bigger, breaks open. This big shows that here the director changed the script suddenly. Remember?

[1559]
Our structure number 4, where is it?

[1560]
The plot structure. Here. The director's making a sharp turn.

[1561]
An unexpected event. See? Exactly the same. Exactly the same.

[1562]
Here it bounces, boom boom. But here it drops calmly. A candle this big.

[1563]
The momentum has to continue at least, at least has to continue.

[1564]
I think, because there's just a bit left before it can kill it. Surging this much.

[1565]
I think it'll let it survive? No way. Really dropping.

[1566]
This line I'll remove completely. Not important anymore. See? Then turns into, it returns that

[1567]
It returns to use this line instead. We draw it new. Coming to test this point. Here. Going.

[1568]
Going. It's dead. Here's dead. Remove it. Ah, this one's out too. Just this much is enough.

[1569]
All done. Now will there be signs? Coming to a key scene.

[1570]
Should be support. Ah, see? Coming in here, there's a bounce, bounce, bounce.

[1571]
Now, now if we don't exit here. We look here.

[1572]
This still hasn't gone lower. If we look at the bigger swing.

[1573]
We can still view it like this. Remove all of this.

[1574]
So we view it as this swing. Then it shoots up like this. And drops like this.

[1575]
If the director's still holding this side's tail for real, it has to make another HIGH.

[1576]
But my thinking might change a bit. Not change, let's call it being cautious.

[1577]
Because hitting this candle here with this much momentum.

[1578]
To make a HIGH up and beat the major candle here.

[1579]
If it rises with green, lots of green, here it's hard.

[1580]
If it's going to beat this, really it has to beat it by going against the flow completely. Remember? Going against.

[1581]
And another candle rising at least over half.

[1582]
To come beat here, and can be small candles.

[1583]
Let's say.

[1584]
But if it drops with a candle this big and the candle doesn't oppose.

[1585]
It's small.

[1586]
And struggles around

[1587]
Around here.

[1588]
Like this. It's hard to beat. An army this big and you haven't even reached halfway through the large army. You'll have a very hard time reaching the major candle.

[1589]
So it's a caution point. If going around here because it's hitting the support level.

[1590]
Have to be cautious when entering orders. If there's a chance the order's in profit already, move stop loss to break-even.

[1591]
Losing strength. Let's keep watching. See? Rising against it but no strength. Will it continue? Let's see. Seems like no.

[1592]
Here, really no strength to go up. It's hard.

[1593]
If we want it to be easy, hmm, not easy, if we want it to be possible.

[1594]
It would have to be like this period. See how here red came down with force too?

[1595]
Killed the major candle here. Killed it. Oh no wait, not yet, oh haven't killed this one yet.

[1596]
So it could send it back up. Oh this one, the major candle hasn't died yet.

[1597]
See? Coming down then suddenly going up, so there's a chance to send it up.

[1598]
But, but.

[1599]
This candle here's already dead. This one's been killed.

[1600]
So the candle that'll send soldiers to support here to go up.


[1601]
There's none.

[1602]
There's none left.

[1603]
There are only a few soldiers along the border, along this trendline here. Just a bit scattered.

[1604]
Can they fight back up?

[1605]
Like here, when it accessed coming down, it can't cross over here anymore. Here it keeps lifting, talking about going up.

[1606]
But here it has to lift. If it's going to send up, it lift, but it's not lifting, so it's going to tilt down somehow.

[1607]
Don't need to watch yet.

[1608]
Yeah, there's a fight going up. But here, see? It's a scene.

[1609]
And here is whose territory? This candle's. If here's green. Green really green.

[1610]
Is this called a last gasp green? Like there's not much strength left in green to fight back.

[1611]
But it seems unwilling. Because here it's starting to have tails, tails. Not giving up and shooting up.

[1612]
If the next candle's still green going up and continuous, there's a chance they want to fight here.

[1613]
Want to come kill the major candle here.

[1614]
But if it's still a small candle again. Shows this is the last gasp. It might reverse down.

[1615]
See? It's not continuous. We view it as a candle, it's not continuous.

[1616]
That if you combine these 2 candlesticks, you'll get a large pin bar.

[1617]
This is resistance, right?

[1618]
Goes up comes down. Goes up comes down.

[1619]
And if it's a pin bar at resistance, is there a chance to drop?

[1620]
Yes. There's a chance to break this level.

[1621]
Many candles can be combined.

[1622]
Many candles combined still give you a pin bar.

[1623]
This group of candles.

[1624]
Pin bar at resistance.

[1625]
Yeah, see? Will it survive? It drops. As soon as it drops like this.

[1626]
I'm viewing the director as changing the script completely. The top line I'll remove. Not using anymore for sure.

[1627]
Because, because I'll mark here new. Ah, where'd they all go?

[1628]
Borrow this first.

[1629]
Here I make it starting, High.

[1630]
What's this?

[1631]
It's

[1632]
Goes up just this much then drops. So here will become

[1633]
High.

[1634]
And it's lower already. It's lower than this, so it has to

[1635]
Has to be Lower Low for sure. Definitely has a Lower Low somewhere, don't know where.

[1636]
Keep it waiting for now.

[1637]
See? Momentum came. Dead already. But this one's still there. This major candle's still lying here. Lying here.

[1638]
Will it take it? Will it kill it? With the momentum sent. Here sent. See?

[1639]
Normally, at the momentum sent, it should send and continue already.

[1640]
And soldiers will come back to rest. Top up supplies casually.

[1641]
When they retreat back, whoosh comes down.

[1642]
Send army number 2 down around the same time.

[1643]
The momentum sent here has broken through this level already. This line.

[1644]
And look here.

[1645]
Only tiny soldiers.

[1646]
Will definitely reach here. Here I think will definitely reach.

[1647]
Will definitely reach the major candle's room here. It's so far.

[1648]
Reaches perfectly. See? Kill it? Not sure.

[1649]
Might be evenly matched. Evenly matched. But like this, killed completely. Remove it.

[1650]
Dead. This way's dead. Dead, so where to go?

[1651]
There's a chance to come to next support. Next scene. The scene after.

[1652]
Like here. Dead. And there. This one. Right? Reached. But. Now if we look, it's

[1653]
Starting to be down candles. For it to come down to here with strong force again, let's keep watching.

[1654]
Okay, here. Very short already. And very small. Small already. I think it has to

[1655]
Curve back up to test this level a bit.

[1656]
After making it, we can say it's the start of a downtrend. High then Low gone.

[1657]
Down from the structure, Lower Low. Then the director changed the script structure. And we follow the director.

[1658]
Just this much. Not hard. I'd say quite changing. Changing too violently.

[1659]
This period turned too sharply. So it has to make a new swing.

[1660]
Because with the structure and form, there's no arm to have the strength to rise.

[1661]
Like the last soldier trying to die more than anything.

[1662]
Here. Don't see.

[1663]
This candle's here.

[1664]
Sent to support.

[1665]
But can it fight back? This candle's still lying here.

[1666]
And it'll fight back. But it won't make it. Even just beating this candle's already hard.

[1667]
These ones keep getting smaller. There's a chance to drop more.

[1668]
It's consolidated. As soon as it consolidates, I can put it here. Right? Because it's consolidated.

[1669]
It's a swing already. Endorfer high. Once it makes endorfer high, it has to have lower, right?

[1670]
Has to have lower than this for sure.

[1671]
Is this it? The major candle's here. Coming down there are signs, bounces up.

[1672]
At the major candle level, whether it survives or not, there has to be a battle.

[1673]
There's price oscillation. Oscillating. Broke from the trendline.

[1674]
Remove the trendline for now. Let's watch the situation first.

[1675]
As long as it hasn't made a high higher than this High.

[1676]
Can beat, come back. Here. It still has a signal of downtrend structure. Ah.

[1677]
Goes up, hits, tests resistance. Then drops. Ah, right. See?

[1678]
Lower than this Low. Here goes lower, lower, lower than this Low.

[1679]
And still gets lower, lower, lower than this Low. If it's a swing point.

[1680]
It walks along. And will it drop more? I view it will drop more. Why? See?

[1681]
This is very small already. Last gasp. Emerged from water.

[1682]
Will sink or not sink. The major candle's here. See anything?

[1683]
Is the major candle dead yet? Closed already. Here the price closed lower than this one.

[1684]
This army's dead. If dead, what's left below?

[1685]
Around here. And if we look, have to go back far.

[1686]
Only this left.

[1687]
Just a bit.

[1688]
Don't think it'll be a very strong army.

[1689]
Think they should be able to break through down.

[1690]
From the momentum coming down.

[1691]
See?

[1692]
Coming down.

[1693]
Continuous downward momentum.

[1694]
These 3 consecutive candles are considered strong.

[1695]
The momentum's already sent.

[1696]
If it's a car, it shifted to high gear, then slowly into peak gear, then into low gear going down, the car flows fast, sliding or skiing down.

[1697]
Will definitely break through here. No large army here to defend. To send soldiers to fight at all.

[1698]
Lower high too.

[1699]
If it's going to be Lower Low, it has to go Lower Low.

[1700]
See? Dropping more.


[1701]
The oscillation's long too. Because look how it consolidated down. This one. And then mark it new.

[1702]
Mark it new means keep adjusting it continuously.

[1703]
And adjust to change into resistance.

[1704]
Whoa, can't take it.

[1705]
Ah, bounce. See? See this scene?

[1706]
Here's a resistance level. Because this one broke down already. See?

[1707]
Momentum. And when it tries to go up, it runs out of strength. It hits resistance.

[1708]
Green hits red's resistance. The major candle's lying here.

[1709]
Oh, the bedroom's here. This is the trendline I marked up new to update it.

[1710]
See? It reacts around here. This period.

[1711]
Keep watching continuously. Yeah, trendline breaks. They remove it. Not hard at all.

[1712]
Just think new, make new. Just that. This one remove it too. That's changing. Can see already.

[1713]
The plot changes. But the plot's still a downtrend continuously. As long as it hasn't made a High higher than this High.

[1714]
It'll still have to be a Lower High.

[1715]
In summary, you should understand. The method of reading charts like a movie. Don't know what to call it.

[1716]
The foreigner who taught me when I took a recent course, he taught reading candlesticks like this. This detailed. Watch strength, watch momentum.

[1717]
Not the whole chart. Not looking for, like, reversal candles. Where are they? Are there reversal candles? What's this? Morning Star?

[1718]
See a Morning Star? Then why doesn't it rise?

[1719]
Nothing.

[1720]
And the tricks that, this other thing he didn't mention, he only talks about support levels.

[1721]
This thing, you can mark according to peaks. Like this. Or according to groups of candlesticks that

[1722]
Cluster together. Groups that cluster, whichever way like this, you can mark as a level.

[1723]
A bit, mark as a level. Here, wherever clusters, you mark, mark, mark.

[1724]
Mark like this. You can mark support and resistance this way. This is talking technically.

[1725]
Just that our trick adds more. With these candles here.

[1726]
These major candles. The major candle has a bedroom, has a base always at the very back.

[1727]
The other side tries. If the other side wants to invade the opposite side's territory.

[1728]
Have to kill the major candle. If don't kill the major candle, they keep sending soldiers to support.

[1729]
Or if you're skilled yourself, you yourself can fight enemies back anytime.

[1730]
Get it? The major candle's like this, can keep fighting like this.

[1731]
And keep sending new armies, sending new armies like this.

[1732]
So this point I don't see any at all.

[1733]
Here, how will I mark resistance here?

[1734]
There's a strong order here. See? Like past ones like this. Here.

[1735]
Look. Here, here. Why's it here? And price is just here and goes.

[1736]
Well, it's here. The candle's here. The bedroom's right here. The candle.

[1737]
Why, for real, the price will bounce. Has to come here. Hmm.

[1738]
Let's try measuring Fibo. Will we get it?

[1739]
Around like this.

[1740]
One more thing to give you as a bonus. That is

[1741]
Or you measure leg by leg. When measuring upward legs, you measure here, put 100 at the bottom.

[1742]
Measuring retracement rate. Put 100 at the bottom here.

[1743]
Then drag up to the swing point at the top here. And it retraces down.

[1744]
And the retracement points are 30, 60, 61.8 around here.

[1745]
See? It retracted to 61.8.

[1746]
Then it goes up. It's a scientific point. Um, psychological point.

[1747]
When we measure retracement, we measure following the trend first. Like this.

[1748]
Here. Take from the upward swing. This one will drop, right? Then how far will it drop?

[1749]
I drag it. See? 61.8. It comes around here.

[1750]
Reverses. If you look like a cat at the major candle. Look like a cat, use Fibo, you'll see like this.

[1751]
But really, you look at major candles. These ones. There'll always be someone who wants to kill them.

[1752]
If you want to reclaim territory. You have to kill the major candle.

[1753]
You have to hurt these armies. If you can't hurt them, how will you take the other side's territory?

[1754]
Get it? Just this. You trade following this. Following the structure.

[1755]
This is the plot. Trade following the plot. Whose script is supporting whom?

[1756]
We go with that. Hide along with them.

[1757]
And look for key scenes, key scenes. Look at the characters.

[1758]
These are the important ones. The main characters. The leaders.

[1759]
When the leader dies, the whole group dies. Get it?

[1760]
These armies are just for reading the symptoms of candlesticks, of momentum, that's all.

[1761]
So I hope this course, for those who are already skilled, you've gained some additional techniques to add to yourself.

[1762]
As for beginners, I think after this course.

[1763]
You'll have ideas, have methods, and you'll be able to survive in this market.

[1764]
Much better than before. The percentage is definitely much higher than before.

[1765]
So now, we'd like to thank you for following along all the way.

[1766]
Thank you very much. Goodbye.
