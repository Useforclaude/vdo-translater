================================================================================

[Segment 1] 3.660s → 7.080s
Let's take a look at stocks, because it also works with stocks the same way.

[Segment 2] 8.380s → 29.040s
Let's try switching to Apple. I prepared this earlier because these two sections are quite similar. They're both three-peak patterns exactly the same.

[Segment 3] 29.040s → 33.780s
Same pattern, see? But why did one go up and the other go down? Let's take a look. At this point.

[Segment 4] 34.560s → 39.020s
Just remember this image first. Okay, same pattern. Let's look at this point first. Zoom in.

[Segment 5] 46.080s → 53.180s
If you just look at this, when price came up to this point, same as before. We find the swing. Price swung up here.

[Segment 6] 53.440s → 57.680s
This one is the highest peak on the right. And it's right here.

[Segment 7] 59.360s → 63.280s
Look, is there Action? Here's the Action, rising strongly. Reaction is this one.

[Segment 8] 63.280s → 72.880s
This one isn't it, it must be this color. See? They're evenly matched.

[Segment 9] 72.880s → 79.580s
So at this point, is there a lot of Reaction force going down? Not a lot. There's little, not enough to go down significantly.

[Segment 10] 79.780s → 83.700s
It came down about this much. Do you remember the formula? The formula, if it becomes a pattern like this.

[Segment 11] 84.240s → 89.120s
Suppose it becomes a Triple top, right? At this point there must be little force going down. Little down force, but a lot of Reaction force. Going down a lot, that's when it breaks out.

[Segment 12] 89.740s → 94.780s
Let's see how it turns out. It's about here. Once this is done, it moves over.

[Segment 13] 95.700s → 100.400s
So it swings to this point. This is Action Reaction going up. So it runs up.

[Segment 14] 100.780s → 104.860s
See? It came up about the same level as before. Because at this point there's a lot of force. It keeps running up.

[Segment 15] 108.840s → 127.560s
Coming to this point. Actually I would count this point. Count at this point.

[Segment 16] 127.880s → 133.500s
I choose to use this candlestick. Because actually it swung up to here.

[Segment 17] 135.200s → 144.720s
Then it came down and swung number one, like with stocks. With stocks, the price might not be exactly like forex.

[Segment 18] 146.960s → 153.740s
It might have an open swing that comes here, it might fill the swing here first. Let's take a look.

[Segment 19] 154.300s → 159.760s
Currently at this point. This is Action, this is Reaction. About halfway.

[Segment 20] 160.400s → 169.380s
So you see? The force going down here isn't a lot yet. It only came down this much and went back up.

[Segment 21] 169.940s → 174.420s
Went back up. Now we'll observe at this point. We'll get this.

[Segment 22] 174.420s → 180.180s
This is Action, and Reaction. See? So hitting here, is it strong? It's quite strong. It is strong.

[Segment 23] 180.900s → 185.100s
But it came down. The word 'strong' means there's a chance it could come back and beat the old Low.

[Segment 24] 185.100s → 192.060s
Look at where it came down. Right here. Step step step step step. At this point.

[Segment 25] 192.060s → 194.900s
It beat it, lower than that. Which is at this point. So we'll count this point as where it bounced back up.

[Segment 26] 194.900s → 200.600s
So here becomes the axis. But look at this point.

[Segment 27] 201.020s → 205.540s
See at this point? This exceeds halfway, so we count it. It goes up, up up up.

[Segment 28] 205.920s → 210.900s
And then slams down. At this point, on this side we can barely find it. We'll find it again here.

[Segment 29] 211.300s → 218.140s
Is there Reaction? There's no Reaction. This one doesn't exceed. See? Just this much isn't enough. So it didn't go up at all. It went down further.

[Segment 30] 218.140s → 226.040s
So it went down further because the upward force, the upward Reaction force, there's nothing to push it up at this point.

[Segment 31] 228.380s → 237.980s
It went down further. Because if we follow our Momentum, the downward force is still a lot.

[Segment 32] 237.980s → 238.960s
The selling force slammed down this much. And when we measure Action Reaction from here, it's a lot, you see? The Reaction side is a lot.

[Segment 33] 239.640s → 241.360s
Its force is still strong downward like this. It came up, came up, came up. Didn't reach here. Not enough force.

[Segment 34] 241.360s → 243.060s
We measured earlier. It came down. But it didn't go up at this point. Until it came down to here. This is another swing.

[Segment 35] 243.340s → 244.920s
When it gets to this point, what is this? Action Reaction is here, see that it's higher?

[Segment 36] 245.160s → 246.500s
When comparing this point with this point, or this one with this one, this is Reaction that has much stronger force than before.

[Segment 37] 246.500s → 247.780s
So the price will run upward, and rush up. This high beats it, it's very strong, so it takes this High, not this High.

[Segment 38] 248.340s → 249.340s
This is the answer. Not taking this High, this is the latest High. At this point.

[Segment 39] 249.820s → 253.200s
At this point there's already a chance to beat it from here going up. But the question is, why at this point?

[Segment 40] 253.200s → 253.980s
You have to look at this too. It's called looking at its distance. About this much for one. And from here to another one.

[Segment 41] 253.980s → 255.660s
See that the distance is about the same? Evenly matched, close to each other. So we'll count it as a quasi-cycle. As a cycle.

[Segment 42] 255.660s → 259.800s
As a recurring pattern. One wave here, one wave here. That it should go up.

[Segment 43] 259.800s → 262.400s
So I count at this High. It has a chance to rally up. This one counts as resistance for sure. Hits hits hits at this point.

[Segment 44] 262.720s → 268.020s
This is the point we'll look at again. Where it went Sideways and stuck. The third one might have to go down like this.

[Segment 45] 268.020s → 269.860s
Let's find out, at this third range, is there anywhere hitting strongly down? That would break down from here like this.

[Segment 46] 269.860s → 272.600s
So it would become a Triple top. After it swung down, we have to move to this one.

[Segment 47] 273.020s → 276.680s
The line is right here. So when price fell to this red one, this block becomes Action, while the green becomes Reaction at this point.

[Segment 48] 277.220s → 282.560s
Price will surge up. It has to go down further. Beat this High going up. Down down down.

[Segment 49] 282.560s → 294.380s
I'll tell you that in the end, from this point, the price here is quite a lot. The force sending here is quite a lot.

[Segment 50] 294.380s → 297.820s
It will bring the price running up until it reaches this level. According to the force being strong from here already.

[Segment 51] 297.820s → 302.060s
In a close cycle. Let's go back. Starting from this point, right?

[Segment 52] 302.060s → 305.340s
See? It'll be close to each other. Price runs up to about this range exactly.

[Segment 53] 305.340s → 312.540s
Now it will break out to another one at this point. At this point it zigzags. You have to try to analyze this, at this point.

[Segment 54] 312.540s → 315.780s
Here, going up. The one hitting down is at this point. Here's the one going up. Like this, so it couldn't go up much.

[Segment 55] 316.420s → 319.420s
Came down to this point. At this point the force is stronger. Stronger than here. So it could come up to this point. Beat this High.

[Segment 56] 319.420s → 321.960s
Because at this point it has higher force than here. And at this point it beat it too.

[Segment 57] 323.700s → 329.340s
It's not saying it will go up this much. But it does beat the old High. The latest one is right here. How much?

[Segment 58] 329.340s → 336.140s
From this point. See? Measuring the green here, Reaction won. It went up.

[Segment 59] 336.920s → 342.920s
But from the big one, at this point that says it must go up and beat this High already, it came up all the way to this one.

[Segment 60] 342.920s → 346.900s
When it gets to this point, we know the same thing. This means at this point, the third point of this one must be the strongest. It must be around here.

[Segment 61] 346.900s → 359.320s
Let's take a look. Now let's look at this peak first. This peak. We'll use this one.

[Segment 62] 359.320s → 360.300s
Is there Action? There is Action. Action is here. Action real time, Reaction that exceeds halfway.

[Segment 63] 361.140s → 364.880s
It gets about this much, about this one, about halfway, but here it's right here.

[Segment 64] 365.060s → 368.500s
See that it's very different from this? So can it go down strongly? It can't go down strongly. It only came down this much.

[Segment 65] 368.940s → 373.120s
Going up further. Going up further, which line will it get? It'll get this one, at this point.

[Segment 66] 373.120s → 377.900s
The Action side. This will be this one. The Reaction will be this one. It already exceeds halfway. They match.

[Segment 67] 378.180s → 379.760s
See? Is the force enough? It's not enough to come down this much. Not at all, it's less than before.

[Segment 68] 382.860s → 398.020s
This one is still at this point. One is at this point. Both are little. Both are little, so swinging to this point.

[Segment 69] 398.840s → 402.780s
Here it went down little. It only managed to get this much. But when you look at this point. At this point.

[Segment 70] 405.120s → 413.240s
And this is Action, we'll get this green here. While Reaction is this red that fell down.

[Segment 71] 414.400s → 422.640s
See that it's a lot? From little, a lot at this point. Strong force falling down all the way to here. All the way to here.

[Segment 72] 423.820s → 430.320s
Once it reaches here, can it continue going down right away? If it's going to continue down, it should be, what's it called, rally up a bit.

[Segment 73] 430.320s → 432.720s
Come down like this and go up, then at this point it has to be strong again and fall down further.

[Segment 74] 433.280s → 436.680s
But here it fell down. At this point it supported it. Like this. Can it go up strongly?

[Segment 75] 436.680s → 439.580s
This one, when it came up, will it become an uptrend continuing? At this point when it came up, you see? These three.

[Segment 76] 439.580s → 444.440s
One two three peaks, and it continues up. At first we didn't know. At this point we didn't know. In hindsight it has to be three peaks. Peak one, peak two.

[Segment 77] 444.440s → 447.820s
Peak three, then continue up? We have to look at this point. Mostly at this point, will it go down strongly? We already know it goes down strongly.

[Segment 78] 448.460s → 451.820s
Because it's stronger than the previous two times. So it slammed down this far. But it supports here.

[Segment 79] 452.780s → 457.640s
It's around the support level. Fell and might go up. Let's look at its force. At this point it becomes Action.

[Segment 80] 458.820s → 463.160s
And Reaction is this one. Can it fight? It can't fight. It can't fight, so it goes up little.

[Segment 81] 464.420s → 469.220s
It came up just this much, doesn't beat this High. Simply put, whether it goes up little or a lot.

[Segment 82] 469.220s → 473.040s
If you can't guess, it still doesn't beat the old High. It still goes, runs but still doesn't beat the old High.

[Segment 83] 473.300s → 476.500s
Slams down. Meets this one. Swings a bit. Slams down. Is there strong downward force?

[Segment 84] 476.500s → 479.760s
This is the Action force, and the Reaction force of this one, because this one doesn't exceed halfway.

[Segment 85] 479.760s → 482.940s
So we take this one. It's still less than this. Doesn't go down at all, see? Somehow it doesn't flow down.

[Segment 86] 482.940s → 487.640s
Huh? Or is it still an uptrend? Goes up again, where does it meet? The High before swinging down.

[Segment 87] 488.060s → 493.000s
It must be this one. It already broke down. See? Look at the Reaction, it's still little. This one is little too. Is this one going down?

[Segment 88] 493.360s → 495.980s
Not yet down. Huh? Or will it go up? So, it came down to this one. This one still says it won't go up.

[Segment 89] 496.680s → 498.440s
Because, see that this green and this red, this green doesn't beat this. It still can't go up. Still can't beat the High.

[Segment 90] 499.460s → 503.280s
If I want to try drawing a line, a bit, it would be about this. Resistance level right around this area.

[Segment 91] 503.280s → 505.180s
Coming down. Can it go up strongly? If it goes up strongly, it can't go up again. How?

[Segment 92] 506.320s → 507.620s
Stuck here, there's no force to go up. Cannot beat the High. Because it came up this swing and fell down.

[Segment 93] 507.920s → 508.420s
Suppose we only see up to here. Can we still measure it yet? Because we don't know the swing point yet, right?

[Segment 94] 509.940s → 510.640s
Action must be this candle already. The green Action that becomes Action continues behind.

[Segment 95] 511.720s → 521.000s
While Reaction will become this one. See? It becomes that at this point it's a lot now.

[Segment 96] 521.900s → 527.140s
Previously it wasn't a lot yet. There's this one point where it's a lot. Then it fell here. So it broke out.

[Segment 97] 527.140s → 531.920s
You broke out. Actually, can we count it as a downtrend? We can count it already. HIGH-LOW, LOWER-HIGH, LOWER-LOW, LOWER-HIGH.

[Segment 98] 531.920s → 536.780s
Next doesn't need to be LOWER-LOW already. If we put them together, this we talk just casually about candlesticks and everything.

[Segment 99] 542.180s → 549.540s
Which is ACTION and REACTION, we just look at this much. If anyone looks more than this, you see many more signals already.

[Segment 100] 549.540s → 553.480s
As for those who learned Season 2, you see this wave series. You already know what the future will be. Very precisely for sure.

[Segment 101] 553.480s → 559.120s
And this one comes to confirm it makes you play more accurately. Let's look at this. See? ACTION and REACTION.

[Segment 102] 560.160s → 566.760s
Because at this point it's a lot. This is a lot of force going down. And in the end where did it go down to?

[Segment 103] 567.640s → 573.600s
It has to go down and beat the old Low already. So it goes down, flows down. About this much, see the difference between the two periods.

[Segment 104] 577.100s → 584.560s
That have the same pattern exactly. Both are three heads exactly the same. But one it doesn't take down. It takes up.

[Segment 105] 585.380s → 591.460s
But at this point it says take down. Because you see the points are different. The balance measurement that it says.

[Segment 106] 592.380s → 598.460s
Here, price runs up, runs up, runs up. Does it say anything? Why does price keep running up?

[Segment 107] 599.080s → 606.780s
Uh, let's look at the daily chart instead. Let's look at the daily. See?

[Segment 108] 607.440s → 615.760s
Here, price was running running running running running around this area. And then it ran up.

[Segment 109] 616.560s → 619.320s
Which point made it run up? Starting from beating this High. You look at this one.

[Segment 110] 619.660s → 621.480s
See? Here is the lowest. Measure it. This is its axis. Action Reaction.

[Segment 111] 621.480s → 623.540s
See clearly? See that it beats this? Anyway it will beat this High for sure. From this series.

[Segment 112] 623.960s → 626.560s
It's already telling if you can see and read. That's all. It has traces. There are still many more today.

[Segment 113] 626.560s → 629.600s
But it might not be told in this class. This one just takes this topic, see that it says, here, anyway it will exceed.

[Segment 114] 629.600s → 631.640s
It might come up zigzagging, not smoothly. But we have signals already that anyway it will reach. It came to reach until achieved.

[Segment 115] 631.640s → 633.760s
To summarize, came down to rest according to normal price patterns. And then continue. That's all.

[Segment 116] 633.760s → 636.400s
If we look in periods, came up, came down. Now will it break, will it be able to go up again?

[Segment 117] 636.720s → 642.020s
At which point? At this point. See? It still can't go up. See? The force is better than before.

[Segment 118] 642.780s → 643.960s
At this point? Counting this one. See? Red. Action still beats. So it couldn't go up far. Not past this point yet.

[Segment 119] 645.680s → 648.260s
Came up. Fell to this point. Count, this swing counts new. This swing has good force. Going up, it goes up.

[Segment 120] 649.240s → 651.600s
Strong hitting on the ladder, will it slam down? The downward hitting force, it's not a lot. Here it's not a lot. So it doesn't take down, that's all.

[Segment 121] 652.220s → 656.960s
Now at this point. This is Bitcoin. Crypto can still be used. Already said that the technique can be used everywhere if you can read.

[Segment 122] 656.960s → 661.280s
Does it beat? It beats. Goes up. Done. No tricks. See? Candlesticks don't trick. Price doesn't trick.

[Segment 123] 661.580s → 669.720s
You just know what it is, the price source. That's all. But the graph you see, you see like, see casually like this.

[Segment 124] 672.760s → 677.880s
You know what? What is it saying? Can't see it at all. Suppose we haven't seen the next period yet.

[Segment 125] 678.460s → 682.400s
Where to look? This one is big red. This one is big green. Directly, do they cancel each other or what? All confused.

[Segment 126] 682.400s → 687.080s
This is the way to look. One part. In this part. The part before this, part one, you read momentum.

[Segment 127] 687.080s → 691.440s
Did the small beat the large, fight each other? Couldn't fight, so it keeps going up. This big green has high force.

[Segment 128] 691.900s → 692.800s
You follow the story. It tells a story, how it came. Those who learned Season 2 came. You look at this, it's a secret inside.

[Segment 129] 697.000s → 702.900s
Says how it is. Actually from this series, it already says that price will continue up.

[Segment 130] 702.900s → 704.040s
Those who learned Season 2, you'll know in advance already. That's all. Okay?

[Segment 131] 704.040s → 705.760s
So that you understand, you'll have complete components. The more you use this part and that part, whoever learns a lot is better off.

[Segment 132] 709.220s → 710.740s
Learn everything completely, you bring them to combine together. You'll read the chart much better than others for sure.

[Segment 133] 710.740s → 716.800s
From all these secrets. All these secrets. I wish you good luck.

[Segment 134] 716.800s → 718.060s
This green doesn't beat this.

[Segment 135] 718.500s → 720.580s
It still can't go up. Still can't beat the High.

[Segment 136] 721.560s → 723.920s
If I want to try drawing a line, a bit.

[Segment 137] 726.020s → 727.700s
It would be about this.

[Segment 138] 728.740s → 730.560s
Resistance level right around this area.

[Segment 139] 731.340s → 734.600s
Coming down. Can it go up strongly? If it goes up strongly, it can't go up again.

[Segment 140] 735.080s → 738.140s
How? Stuck here, there's no force to go up. Cannot beat the High.

[Segment 141] 738.140s → 741.960s
Because it came up this swing and fell down. Suppose we only see up to here.

[Segment 142] 742.860s → 760.540s
Can we still measure it yet? Because we don't know the swing point yet, right?

[Segment 143] 761.020s → 762.940s
Action must be this candle already. Action.

[Segment 144] 764.300s → 766.100s
The green that becomes Action continues behind.

[Segment 145] 766.740s → 769.000s
While Reaction will become this one. See?

[Segment 146] 770.680s → 774.740s
It becomes that at this point it's a lot now. Previously it wasn't a lot yet.

[Segment 147] 774.740s → 777.280s
There's this one point where it's a lot. Then it fell here.

[Segment 148] 777.280s → 779.820s
So it broke out. You broke out.

[Segment 149] 779.820s → 782.560s
Actually, can we count it as a downtrend? We can count it already.

[Segment 150] 783.100s → 786.520s
HIGH-LOW, LOWER-HIGH, LOWER-LOW, LOWER-HIGH.

[Segment 151] 786.520s → 787.780s
Next doesn't need to be LOWER-LOW already.

[Segment 152] 788.320s → 789.560s
If we put them together.

[Segment 153] 789.560s → 796.020s
This we talk just casually about the candlestick set and everything.

[Segment 154] 796.020s → 798.880s
Which is ACTION and REACTION.

[Segment 155] 799.120s → 800.560s
We just look at this much.

[Segment 156] 801.500s → 803.920s
If anyone looks more than this, you see many more signals already.

[Segment 157] 806.180s → 808.380s
As for those who learned Season 2, you see this wave series.

[Segment 158] 808.380s → 811.040s
You already know what the future will be. Very precisely for sure.

[Segment 159] 812.140s → 814.800s
And this one comes to confirm it, makes you play more accurately.

[Segment 160] 815.820s → 818.220s
Let's look at this. See? ACTION and REACTION.

[Segment 161] 818.220s → 819.520s
Because dragging this down a lot.

[Segment 162] 819.520s → 822.520s
This is a lot of force going down.

[Segment 163] 822.520s → 824.380s
And in the end where did it go down to? It has to go down and beat it.

[Segment 164] 824.820s → 827.760s
Look at the old one first. It goes down, flows down.

[Segment 165] 829.160s → 834.240s
About this much, see the difference between the two periods that have the same pattern exactly.

[Segment 166] 834.240s → 837.440s
Both are three heads exactly the same. But one it doesn't take down. It takes up.

[Segment 167] 837.440s → 840.900s
But at this point it says take down. Because you see the points are different.

[Segment 168] 841.320s → 857.580s
The balance measurement that it says. The weight it gives.

[Segment 169] 857.580s → 861.280s
Here, price runs up, runs up, runs up. Does it say anything?

[Segment 170] 861.660s → 865.200s
Why does price keep running up? Uh, let's look at the daily chart instead.

[Segment 171] 866.800s → 867.660s
Let's look at the daily. Good.

[Segment 172] 871.060s → 876.120s
See? Here, price was running running running running running around this area.

[Segment 173] 876.120s → 880.380s
And then it ran up. Which point made it run up?

[Segment 174] 880.940s → 884.740s
Starting from beating this High. You look at this one. See? Here is the lowest.

[Segment 175] 886.140s → 893.700s
Measure it. This is its axis.

[Segment 176] 895.520s → 900.660s
Action Reaction, see clearly?

[Segment 177] 902.520s → 907.960s
See that it beats this? Anyway it will beat this High for sure. From this series.

[Segment 178] 910.160s → 912.800s
It's already telling, just can you see and read?

[Segment 179] 912.800s → 918.560s
That's all. It has traces. There are still many more today. But it might not be told in this class.

[Segment 180] 918.560s → 922.220s
This one just takes this topic, see that it says, here, anyway it will exceed.

[Segment 181] 922.220s → 929.280s
It might come up zigzagging, not smoothly. But we have signals already that anyway it will reach.

[Segment 182] 929.940s → 937.640s
It came to reach until achieved. To summarize, came down to rest according to normal price patterns. And then continue.

[Segment 183] 938.220s → 947.440s
That's all. If we look in periods, came up, came down. Now will it break, will it be able to go up again?

[Segment 184] 947.440s → 958.360s
At which point? At this point. See? It still can't go up. See? The force is better than before.

[Segment 185] 962.860s → 969.560s
At this point? Counting this one. See? Red. Action still beats. So it couldn't go up far.

[Segment 186] 969.560s → 977.160s
Not past this point yet. Came up. Fell to this point. Count, this swing counts new. This swing has good force.

[Segment 187] 977.160s → 980.580s
Going up, it goes up. Strong hitting on the ladder, will it slam down?

[Segment 188] 980.580s → 983.220s
The downward hitting force, it's not a lot. Here it's not a lot.

[Segment 189] 983.220s → 986.500s
So it doesn't take down, that's all. Now at this point.

[Segment 190] 987.900s → 990.000s
This is Bitcoin. Crypto can still be used.

[Segment 191] 990.000s → 993.220s
Already said that the technique can be used everywhere if you can read.

[Segment 192] 1000.060s → 1004.740s
Does it beat? It beats. Goes up. Done. No tricks.

[Segment 193] 1005.200s → 1007.700s
See? Candlesticks don't trick. Price doesn't trick.

[Segment 194] 1007.700s → 1010.020s
You just need to know how to read the clues that price is showing you.

[Segment 195] 1010.360s → 1013.140s
That's all. But the graph you see, you see like,

[Segment 196] 1014.180s → 1016.980s
see casually like this. You know what? What is it saying?

[Segment 197] 1016.980s → 1019.660s
Can't see it at all. Suppose we haven't seen the next period yet.

[Segment 198] 1020.040s → 1023.580s
Where to look? This one is big red. This one is big green.

[Segment 199] 1023.580s → 1026.700s
Directly, do they cancel each other or what? All confused.

[Segment 200] 1026.700s → 1029.920s
This is the way to look. One part. In this part.

[Segment 201] 1029.920s → 1033.900s
The part before this, part one, you read momentum.

[Segment 202] 1033.900s → 1037.980s
Can the main force on this side fight back? They can't win, so it keeps going up.

[Segment 203] 1037.980s → 1042.120s
This big green has high force. You follow the story. It tells a story, how it came.

[Segment 204] 1042.520s → 1046.640s
Those who learned Season 2, you look at this, it's a secret inside.

[Segment 205] 1046.640s → 1047.720s
Says how it is.

[Segment 206] 1047.720s → 1051.620s
Actually from this series, it already says that price will continue up.

[Segment 207] 1051.620s → 1055.160s
Those who learned Season 2, you'll know in advance already.

[Segment 208] 1056.720s → 1064.320s
That's all. Okay? So that you understand, you'll have complete components. The more you use this part and that part, whoever learns a lot is better off.

[Segment 209] 1064.320s → 1069.980s
Learn everything completely, you bring them to combine together. You'll read the chart much better than others for sure.

[Segment 210] 1069.980s → 1074.580s
From all these secrets. All these secrets. I wish you good luck.
