[Segment 1] 2.240s → 20.720s
Alright, let's jump into Reversal Candlestick - this is a special episode, folks.

[Segment 2] 20.720s → 27.260s
Yeah, this one's gonna be focused on reversal candlesticks.

[Segment 3] 27.680s → 41.760s
Now, those of you who've been following from the beginning know what's up.

[Segment 4] 42.380s → 45.520s
If you're new here, let me fill you in a bit.

[Segment 5] 45.520s → 49.720s
Basically, this whole series came from one simple question.

[Segment 6] 49.960s → 54.260s
Students were asking, "What's the difference between Season 1 and Season 2?"

[Segment 7] 54.260s → 57.000s
What are we actually learning here?

[Segment 8] 57.000s → 60.420s
So I thought, alright, let me break it down for you guys.

[Segment 9] 60.420s → 63.500s
Season 1, right? That was all about the basics.

[Segment 10] 64.800s → 66.940s
What we call Foundation, the fundamentals.

[Segment 11] 67.300s → 70.600s
Look, there are tons of different indicators out there.

[Segment 12] 73.500s → 75.560s
Some folks swear by RSI, others love MACD.

[Segment 13] 76.000s → 78.740s
You know what I mean?

[Segment 14] 79.280s → 80.840s
So many different tools, and yeah, people use all kinds of stuff.

[Segment 15] 81.740s → 84.260s
Everyone's got their own preferred tools.

[Segment 16] 84.260s → 89.240s
Now, in this course - and I gotta be clear about this.

[Segment 17] 89.240s → 93.780s
I'm not telling you this is the ONLY way to trade.

[Segment 18] 94.040s → 97.800s
What I'm teaching you is Price Action.

[Segment 19] 101.680s → 105.200s
That's our approach, Price Action.

[Segment 20] 107.020s → 111.600s
Price Action means we're reading and analyzing just the price movement itself.

[Segment 21] 111.820s → 115.300s
Basically looking at candlestick charts and understanding what they're telling us.

[Segment 22] 115.300s → 121.940s
And here's the thing - Season 1 had two main parts.

[Segment 23] 121.940s → 124.920s
First part was Dow Theory.

[Segment 24] 124.920s → 129.140s
Now Dow Theory's got six principles.

[Segment 25] 129.140s → 131.500s
Actually, some people say there are more.

[Segment 26] 131.500s → 134.340s
And yeah, I might've covered a bit extra beyond the main six.

[Segment 27] 134.340s → 138.060s
But anyway, there were six core principles.

[Segment 28] 138.420s → 141.520s
You gotta understand those, right?

[Segment 29] 141.520s → 145.820s
And after Dow Theory?

[Segment 30] 145.820s → 148.360s
We dove into candlesticks.

[Segment 31] 148.900s → 154.040s
And look, when it comes to candlesticks, there are SO many different types and patterns.

[Segment 32] 154.040s → 161.220s
I mean, seriously, tons of them.

[Segment 33] 161.220s → 165.520s
You could spend forever trying to memorize every single candlestick pattern out there.

[Segment 34] 166.180s → 178.000s
But honestly? I'm not gonna make you memorize all that stuff.

[Segment 35] 178.540s → 183.120s
We're gonna keep it simple and practical.

[Segment 36] 183.900s → 188.620s
I'll just show you - "Hey, when you see THIS pattern, here's what it means."

[Segment 37] 188.900s → 193.440s
Basically teaching you what each pattern is telling us, what it's saying about the market.

[Segment 38] 193.660s → 196.920s
And it's not just about recognizing patterns - we need to understand WHY they work.

[Segment 39] 197.220s → 200.460s
Get the logic behind it, you know?

[Segment 40] 200.700s → 205.220s
That way you're not just seeing random shapes - you actually GET what's happening in the market.

[Segment 41] 205.720s → 207.260s
So what does "complementary" mean here?

[Segment 42] 207.520s → 212.960s
Alright, let me explain - sometimes you'll see charts that look different, various patterns, right?

[Segment 43] 213.160s → 215.440s
You might see this pattern, or you might not see that one.

[Segment 44] 215.900s → 220.940s
But here's the thing - if you spot these together, whether it's from Season 1 OR Season 2.

[Segment 45] 220.940s → 225.520s
The more clues you stack up, the stronger your conviction becomes.

[Segment 46] 225.520s → 230.720s
It really reinforces your forecast - makes it way more likely to play out.

[Segment 47] 230.720s → 234.420s
Yeah, it's gonna follow through just like you predicted.

[Segment 48] 235.180s → 238.260s
So now, what are we gonna talk about in this one?

[Segment 49] 239.200s → 241.040s
Action and Reaction - that's today's topic.

[Segment 50] 241.600s → 243.940s
I know some of you are wondering, "What's Action and Reaction?"

[Segment 51] 245.400s → 247.380s
Think of it like forces, you know? Action force.

[Segment 52] 247.580s → 248.940s
Action and Reaction forces.

[Segment 53] 249.300s → 254.360s
Reaction is basically the force that pushes back in the opposite direction.

[Segment 54] 254.660s → 257.480s
Imagine a ping pong ball, or a soccer ball - whatever works for you.

[Segment 55] 257.760s → 261.120s
You kick it, throw it - it hits the ground.

[Segment 56] 262.080s → 264.760s
That impact force? That's what we call the Action.

[Segment 57] 264.760s → 268.180s
The ground responds by pushing force back.

[Segment 58] 268.500s → 273.640s
That's what makes the ball bounce back up like that.

[Segment 59] 274.420s → 275.000s
Makes sense?

[Segment 60] 275.000s → 280.360s
So the ball comes down, and right here is the impact point.

[Segment 61] 280.360s → 282.760s
And it bounces right back.

[Segment 62] 284.140s → 286.080s
That's the easiest way to explain it.

[Segment 63] 286.080s → 288.500s
Or you could just call it resistance force.

[Segment 64] 288.840s → 290.180s
Imagine if this was a wall.

[Segment 65] 290.180s → 290.540s
Yeah.

[Segment 66] 291.820s → 300.680s
A car crashes into it - BOOM! Right? The force of the car coming from this side, all that energy coming this way, and then...

[Segment 67] 300.680s → 305.200s
What happens to the front of the car? It gets crushed, wrecked. There's a反force coming back.

[Segment 68] 305.200s → 308.560s
It's not just one-way force - it doesn't just pass through or anything like that.

[Segment 69] 308.560s → 313.100s
It's not like the car stays perfectly fine, crashes through the wall and keeps going untouched.

[Segment 70] 313.100s → 317.080s
No way! The car gets damaged, right? That's the reaction force at work.

[Segment 71] 317.080s → 320.680s
Same thing happens with candlesticks, folks.

[Segment 72] 320.680s → 323.360s
Exactly the same principle with price movement.

[Segment 73] 323.360s → 328.300s
So the Action is basically the price running in this direction.

[Segment 74] 329.400s → 331.600s
But normally with candlesticks...

[Segment 75] 331.600s → 334.160s
From Season 1, we were looking for THIS pattern.

[Segment 76] 334.480s → 339.160s
But you can't always find it, right? That's why we have what's called...

[Segment 77] 339.860s → 343.100s
Combined candlesticks. Could be multiple candles - two, three, four, who knows.

[Segment 78] 343.100s → 347.180s
But when you add and subtract all the movement together.

[Segment 79] 347.180s → 350.960s
Boom! It forms a candlestick pattern.

[Segment 80] 350.960s → 354.800s
Like this, which I already explained back in Season 1.

[Segment 81] 354.800s → 360.640s
It represents the反force pushing back - that's one type of pattern.

[Segment 82] 360.640s → 363.560s
Price was running down this way, and when you combine all those candlesticks together...

[Segment 83] 363.560s → 366.660s
You get this formation - buying pressure bouncing back up.

[Segment 84] 366.660s → 368.840s
If it's coming from a downtrend, right? Coming from downward movement.

[Segment 85] 372.400s → 377.640s
When it's coming down - boom, boom, boom - we see candlesticks forming in a cluster.

[Segment 86] 377.640s → 379.360s
They bunch up together, not appearing cleanly like this all at once.

[Segment 87] 380.440s → 382.020s
But when you combine them, you get this formation.

[Segment 88] 382.640s → 384.180s
That wick, right? What it's showing us...

[Segment 89] 384.180s → 386.600s
That's the Reaction happening.

[Segment 90] 386.600s → 389.320s
Bouncing back from that Action side.

[Segment 91] 390.000s → 392.400s
Trying to push price back in the other direction.

[Segment 92] 392.400s → 393.720s
The opposite side.

[Segment 93] 394.320s → 395.880s
But it doesn't always work out that way.

[Segment 94] 395.880s → 398.520s
Sometimes we see a clean pattern like this before candlesticks even combine.

[Segment 95] 398.820s → 400.320s
And we think, "Oh yeah, it's gonna go this way."

[Segment 96] 400.760s → 401.520s
But no way!

[Segment 97] 401.520s → 403.680s
It comes down.

[Segment 98] 403.680s → 405.400s
Gets to this point.

[Segment 99] 405.920s → 406.920s
And keeps going down.

[Segment 100] 406.920s → 409.440s
Because all the elements aren't there yet.

[Segment 101] 409.440s → 410.960s
I already covered this back in Season 1.

[Segment 102] 410.960s → 416.360s
What elements make this pattern work best?

[Segment 103] 417.060s → 423.760s
Don't forget - each candlestick we learned in Season 1 is like a character, showing different character types.

[Segment 104] 424.420s → 431.520s
What makes a character perform their best? Or what they call having the clearest action? That's the SCENE.

[Segment 105] 431.980s → 436.020s
What's a scene? Where should it occur? If you don't remember, go back and review our lessons.

[Segment 106] 437.720s → 442.040s
Let's move on. So here's how it works, folks.

[Segment 107] 442.040s → 447.400s
Action and Reaction - let's say this left side here is the Action.

[Segment 108] 447.840s → 454.340s
This side is Action, and then Reaction comes down - there's a反force pushing back.

[Segment 109] 454.840s → 460.580s
I'm talking about the downtrend side because it's easier to see. On the flip side, we have the uptrend.

[Segment 110] 460.580s → 466.600s
Price moves up, then reverses back down - same concept.

[Segment 111] 467.020s → 472.440s
But when talking about this side, price looks like it's moving up like this, and this side becomes the Reaction.

[Segment 112] 474.780s → 477.900s
Let me give you a simple visual - think of a balance scale.

[Segment 113] 478.480s → 485.120s
A balance scale with arms on both sides like this.

[Segment 114] 487.920s → 490.020s
Simply put, it's measuring forces.

[Segment 115] 490.580s → 493.580s
The force on this side has to be selling pressure.

[Segment 116] 496.400s → 499.080s
While this side has to be buying pressure pushing back.

[Segment 117] 499.860s → 502.240s
But talking about selling pressure and buying pressure gets confusing.

[Segment 118] 502.820s → 506.040s
Right now, if we discuss this, you might get confused - wanna know why?

[Segment 119] 506.280s → 511.800s
Because over here, it's a downtrend - selling pressure is the Action.

[Segment 120] 511.800s → 516.340s
Buying pressure pushing back is the Reaction - it's reversed because we're on the upper side.

[Segment 121] 517.160s → 520.740s
Yeah, price runs up, hits resistance - boom! Reverses.

[Segment 122] 522.040s → 526.680s
Earlier on this side, it was selling pressure - we still call it that.

[Segment 123] 526.680s → 529.440s
Buying pressure becomes the opposite, because it's on this side.

[Segment 124] 529.440s → 532.180s
It becomes buying pressure - we call it buying pressure.

[Segment 125] 532.940s → 537.140s
And selling pressure becomes the other side. Confusing, right? Going back and forth gets messy.

[Segment 126] 537.140s → 539.760s
So from now on, I'm just gonna use TWO words.

[Segment 127] 539.760s → 541.400s
That's Action and Reaction.

[Segment 128] 541.400s → 544.620s
And they stay on the same side consistently.

[Segment 129] 545.820s → 547.100s
Doesn't matter if it's top or bottom.

[Segment 130] 550.720s → 551.940s
Going up? That's Action.

[Segment 131] 553.200s → 554.280s
This one's the Reaction.

[Segment 132] 555.220s → 556.640s
This side coming down? That's Action.

[Segment 133] 556.640s → 557.700s
Going up is Reaction.

[Segment 134] 557.700s → 560.320s
It just becomes left side versus right side, that's all.

[Segment 135] 560.320s → 560.900s
Alright?

[Segment 136] 560.900s → 567.460s
This side - the left - is ALL Action. This side - the right - is ALL Reaction.

[Segment 137] 567.460s → 572.300s
Keep it simple. It's gonna look like this - this is the pattern we're looking for.

[Segment 138] 572.300s → 589.880s
Back in Season 1, we might've only needed this much. But now we want MORE confirmation.

[Segment 139] 589.860s → 589.880s
Stay tuned for the next episode.
