CONTEXT SUMMARY - SS1.5 EP-02
==============================
Created: 2025-10-18

TOPIC:
======
Balance Scale Patterns (Action vs Reaction - Part 2)
- Continuation from EP-01's Action/Reaction concept
- Deep dive into balance scale (ตาช่าง) measurement patterns
- Teaching how to identify and measure the three balance patterns
- Theory-focused episode (practical application comes in next episode)

TEACHING TONE:
==============
- Casual conversational style (same as EP-01)
- Teacher explaining complex concepts with simple analogies
- Uses "ครับ" frequently (remove in translation)
- Step-by-step technical instruction
- Encouraging students to visualize and understand

MAIN CONCEPTS:
==============
1. **Three Balance Scale Patterns:**
   - Pattern 1: Action > Reaction (price continues direction)
   - Pattern 2: Action = Reaction (balanced, uncertain)
   - Pattern 3: Action < Reaction (reversal likely)

2. **Measurement Rules (5 Key Points):**
   - Rule 1: Occurs at resistance/support zones (แนวต้าน/แนวรับ)
   - Rule 2: Axis candlestick (ตัวแกน) - count lowest/highest point INCLUDING wicks
   - Rule 3: Arm candlesticks (แขน) - must exceed 50% of Body (NOT including wicks)
   - Rule 4: Compare forces on both sides
   - Rule 5: Determine which side dominates

3. **Technical Details:**
   - Candlestick body vs wick distinction
   - Axis vs arm identification
   - 50% body rule for valid arm candlesticks
   - Support/resistance zone context

KEY FOREX TERMS:
================
- แท่งเทียน → candlestick (9x)
- ราคา → price (14x)
- แนวต้าน → resistance (5x)
- แนวรับ → support (2x)
- ตัวเทียน/Body → candlestick body
- ไส้เทียน → wick
- Action → Action (keep in English)
- Reaction → Reaction (keep in English)

THAI PARTICLES TO REMOVE:
==========================
- นะ (69x) - softening particle
- ครับ (55x) - polite male particle
- เลย (10x) - emphasis
- แหละ (10x) - emphasis
- เนี้ย (5x) - informal emphasis

METAPHORS/ANALOGIES:
====================
- Balance scale (ตาช่าง) - main teaching metaphor throughout
- Two arms measuring forces
- Weight on each side determining direction
- Simple physics analogy for market forces

TEACHING STRUCTURE:
===================
Intro: Episode 2, balance scale patterns introduction
Part 1: Three pattern types explained (Action >, =, < Reaction)
Part 2: Five measurement rules detailed
Part 3: 50% body rule demonstration with examples
Part 4: Distinguishing valid vs invalid candlesticks
Outro: Theory complete, practical application next episode

TRANSLATION STYLE NOTES:
========================
- Maintain casual teaching tone (Rule #13: Natural human conversation)
- Use "folks", "alright", "right?", "look" for natural flow
- Remove all Thai particles
- Keep Action/Reaction in English (technical terms)
- Translate analogies naturally (balance scale, weights, arms)
- Preserve teaching enthusiasm and step-by-step explanations

SPECIAL CHALLENGES:
===================
1. Technical vocabulary: Body vs wick, axis vs arms
2. Measurement rules need clear explanation in English
3. "50% of body" rule must be precise
4. Balance scale metaphor must be consistent
5. Action/Reaction sides must be clearly distinguished

CONTEXT FOR TRANSLATORS:
========================
This is a theory episode explaining HOW to measure patterns, not showing
real chart examples yet. The instructor is building foundation knowledge.
Next episode will show practical application on actual charts.

The balance scale metaphor is CRITICAL - it helps students visualize:
- Left side = Action (initial force)
- Right side = Reaction (response force)
- Which side is heavier determines price direction

Duration: ~18 minutes (188 segments)
Complexity: Medium-high (technical instruction with rules/measurements)
