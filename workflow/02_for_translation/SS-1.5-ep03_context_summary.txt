CONTEXT SUMMARY - SS1.5 EP-03
==============================
Created: 2025-10-18

TOPIC:
======
Price Cycles and Action/Reaction in Trend Context
- Integration of Action/Reaction with Dow Theory (Higher High/Higher Low)
- Price cycle structure (1 Cycle = uptrend → downtrend or vice versa)
- How Action/Reaction patterns appear at different points in price cycles
- Advanced application: predicting price direction using Season 2 knowledge

TEACHING TONE:
==============
- Casual conversational (same as EP-01 & EP-02)
- Building on previous knowledge from Season 1 & 2
- Encouraging students to visualize cycles and patterns
- Uses "ครับ" frequently (remove in translation)
- More conceptual/theoretical (real chart examples in next episode)

MAIN CONCEPTS:
==============
1. **Price Cycles (1 Cycle):**
   - Uptrend → Downtrend (or vice versa) = 1 complete cycle
   - Higher High (HH), Higher Low (HL) pattern in uptrends
   - Lower Low (LL), Lower High (LH) pattern in downtrends
   - Cycle completion = when pattern breaks

2. **Dow Theory Integration:**
   - Uptrend structure: HL → HH → HL → HH (continues)
   - Downtrend structure: LH → LL → LH → LL (continues)
   - Trend break: No new HH (uptrend fails) or no new LL (downtrend fails)
   - Reversal signals: First LL/LH after uptrend structure breaks

3. **Action/Reaction in Cycles:**
   - Action = initial price movement hitting support/resistance
   - Reaction = bounce/reversal from that zone
   - Patterns occur at key cycle points (tops, bottoms, reversal zones)
   - Integration with Season 1 (Dow Theory) + Season 2 (Advanced patterns)

4. **8 Components Review:**
   - Revisits the 8 measurement rules from EP-02
   - How to identify valid patterns at different cycle stages
   - Emphasis on complete pattern formation before trading

KEY FOREX TERMS:
================
- ราคา → price (23x)
- เทรนด์/แนวโน้ม → trend (6x)
- แท่งเทียน → candlestick (5x)
- แนวต้าน → resistance (4x)
- แนวรับ → support (2x)
- โมเมนตัม → momentum (1x)
- Higher High/Higher Low → HH/HL (keep English)
- Lower Low/Lower High → LL/LH (keep English)
- Uptrend/Downtrend → uptrend/downtrend
- Cycle → cycle
- Action/Reaction → Action/Reaction (keep English)

THAI PARTICLES TO REMOVE:
==========================
- นะ (66x) - softening particle
- ครับ (42x) - polite male particle
- เลย (20x) - emphasis
- แหละ (7x) - emphasis
- เนี้ย (2x) - informal emphasis

DOW THEORY TERMS:
=================
- Higher High (จุดสูงที่สูงขึ้น) → HH
- Higher Low (จุดต่ำที่สูงขึ้น) → HL
- Lower High (จุดสูงที่ต่ำลง) → LH
- Lower Low (จุดต่ำที่ต่ำลง) → LL
- Uptrend (ขาขึ้น) → uptrend
- Downtrend (ขาลง) → downtrend
- 1 Cycle (1 วงจร) → 1 cycle

TEACHING STRUCTURE:
===================
Intro: Recap Action/Reaction, expand details
Part 1: Price cycle concept (1 cycle = up+down or down+up)
Part 2: Dow Theory structure in cycles (HH/HL → LL/LH)
Part 3: Where Action/Reaction patterns appear in cycles
Part 4: Integration of all concepts (Season 1 + 2 + Action/Reaction)
Outro: Review 8 components, next episode shows real charts

TRANSLATION STYLE NOTES:
========================
- Maintain casual teaching tone (Rule #13)
- Keep Dow Theory terms in English (HH, HL, LL, LH)
- Keep Action/Reaction in English (technical terms)
- Use natural flow for cycle explanations
- Remove all Thai particles
- Translate "วงจร" as "cycle" consistently
- "1 Cycle" should stay as "1 cycle" (not "one cycle")

SPECIAL CHALLENGES:
===================
1. Dow Theory terminology must be consistent with Season 1
2. Cycle concept needs clear explanation
3. HH/HL/LL/LH abbreviations must be preserved
4. Integration of multiple concepts (Dow + Action/Reaction)
5. References to "Season 1" and "Season 2" need context

CONTEXT FOR TRANSLATORS:
========================
This episode SYNTHESIZES multiple concepts:
- Season 1: Dow Theory basics (HH/HL/LL/LH)
- Season 2: Advanced patterns (referenced but not detailed)
- SS1.5 EP-01&02: Action/Reaction balance scale patterns

The instructor is showing HOW these concepts work TOGETHER in price cycles.
Real chart examples come in the next episode - this is still theory/framework.

Key insight: Students who learned Season 2 can predict price direction
automatically by combining these concepts. This episode builds that integration.

Duration: ~19.3 minutes (233 segments)
Complexity: Medium-high (conceptual integration of multiple frameworks)
