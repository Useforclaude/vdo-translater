================================================================================
Created: 2025-10-18
Method: Two-Pass Translation (Mandatory)
Purpose: Full document understanding BEFORE translation begins

================================================================================
TOPIC: STOCK MARKET APPLICATION - APPLE CHART ANALYSIS
================================================================================

Main Teaching Focus:
- Demonstrating Action/Reaction works with stocks (not just Forex)
- Apple stock chart analysis
- Comparing three-peak patterns (why one breaks up, one breaks down)
- Market application across different instruments

Context: This is the FINAL episode showing that the same techniques
apply to stocks, crypto (Bitcoin), and all markets.

================================================================================
TEACHING TONE
================================================================================

Conversational Level: MODERATE (less casual than EP-04)
- นะ: 82x (moderate, down from 255x in EP-04!)
- ครับ: 51x (moderate, down from 166x in EP-04!)
- เลย: 38x (moderate)
- เนี้ย: 4x (minimal)
- แหละ: 3x (minimal)
- ซะ: 1x (minimal)

Teaching Style:
- Demonstrative ("Let's look at...", "See?")
- Comparative analysis (comparing two similar chart patterns)
- Patient explanation with visual references ("ตรงนี้", "อันนี้")
- Wrapping up the series with practical examples

================================================================================
KEY FOREX/TRADING TERMS (Keep in English)
================================================================================

Technical Terms:
- Action (10x) - upward price movement
- Reaction (14x) - downward price movement
- swing (สวิง, 8x) - swing points
- High (ไฮ) - peak
- Low (โล) - trough
- Triple top (สามยอด) - three-peak pattern
- Support (แนวรับ) - support level
- Resistance (แนวต้าน) - resistance level
- Breakout (หลุด, เบรก) - price breaks through level
- Rally (rally) - strong upward move
- Momentum (โมเมนตัม) - price momentum

Market Terms:
- หุ้น → stocks (4x)
- Apple → Apple stock (1x)
- Bitcoin/Crypto → Bitcoin/cryptocurrency
- Candlestick (แท่งเทียน) - candlestick chart

Pattern Terms:
- Three peaks (สามยอด) - triple top pattern
- Quasi-cycle (quasi-cycle) - cycle wave
- Higher High, Lower Low (HIGH-LOW) - trend structure
- Sideways (Sideways) - consolidation

================================================================================
METAPHORS & COLLOQUIALISMS
================================================================================

Natural Speech Patterns:
- "เดี๋ยวมาดู" → "Let's take a look"
- "มันก็ใช้ได้" → "it works the same way"
- "เห็นไหม" / "เห็นมั้ย" → "see?" / "you see?"
- "ตรงนี้" → "here" / "at this point"
- "อันนี้" / "ตัวนี้" → "this one"
- "สูสี" → "evenly matched" / "neck and neck"
- "ชนะ" (win) → "breaks through" / "overcomes"
- "วิ่งขึ้น/ลง" (run up/down) → "moves up/down" / "runs up/down"

Force/Power Metaphors:
- "กำลังมันเยอะ" → "has strong force" / "strong momentum"
- "แรงเยอะ" → "strong force"
- "พอไหม/ไม่พอ" → "enough/not enough force"
- "ตบลง" → "slams down" / "drops hard"

Visual References:
- "ตรงนี้" (this point) - appears frequently, referring to chart points
- "อันนี้กับอันนี้" → "this one versus this one"
- "ดูตรงนี้" → "look at this point"

DOCUMENT STRUCTURE
================================================================================

Segment Range | Content Focus
--------------|--------------------------------------------------
1-50          | Intro: Apple stock chart setup, three-peak comparison
51-100        | First three-peak pattern analysis (breaks up)
101-150       | Second three-peak pattern analysis (breaks down)
151-180       | Bitcoin example, demonstrating universality
181-210       | Conclusion: Techniques work across all markets

Teaching Flow:
1. Introduction: Show two similar patterns with different outcomes
2. Pattern 1 Analysis: Why this three-peak broke upward
3. Pattern 2 Analysis: Why this three-peak broke downward
4. Cross-market validation: Bitcoin, stocks, forex all work
5. Summary: Mastering these secrets gives trading edge

TRANSLATION RULES (MUST FOLLOW)
================================================================================

1. **Remove ALL Thai particles** (นะ, ครับ, เลย, เนี้ย, แหละ, ซะ)
2. **Keep technical terms in English** (Action, Reaction, swing, High, Low)
3. **Natural human tone** (Rule #13) - conversational, not robotic
4. **Preserve timestamps exactly** - critical for SRT generation
5. **Context-aware idiom translation** - never literal
6. **Visual references natural** - "here", "at this point", not "at this"
7. **Demonstrative language** - "Let's look", "See?", "Watch this"

================================================================================
SPECIAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THIS EPISODE
================================================================================

1. **Final Episode** - Wraps up the series with practical examples
2. **Cross-Market Focus** - Shows techniques work on stocks, crypto, forex
3. **Comparative Teaching** - Two similar patterns, different outcomes
4. **Visual-Heavy** - Many chart references ("ตรงนี้" appears constantly)
5. **Moderate Particle Count** - Less casual than EP-04, more professional tone
6. **Shorter Duration** - ~18 minutes (vs. 43 minutes for EP-04 Part 2)
7. **Conclusion Tone** - Summarizing learned concepts, encouraging practice

================================================================================
TRANSLATION STRATEGY
================================================================================

Pass 2 Approach:
- Translate segments 1-210 with full context awareness
- Maintain visual reference clarity ("here" vs. "this point")
- Keep comparative language natural ("this one went up, this one went down")
- Preserve teaching enthusiasm for series conclusion
- Ensure technical term consistency with previous episodes

Expected Challenges:
- Many visual references ("ตรงนี้", "อันนี้") - need natural English flow
- Comparative analysis - keep clear which pattern is being discussed
- Technical accuracy - Action/Reaction force comparisons

Expected Duration of Pass 2: ~60-90 minutes (210 segments)
