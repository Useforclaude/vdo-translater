TRANSLATION HIGHLIGHTS
====================================

✓ Topic Understanding:
  - MM tutorial with live software demonstration
  - Two core concepts: Position Sizing + Risk-Reward Ratio
  - Mathematical proof examples (40% win rate = profitable with 1:2 RR)

✓ Teaching Tone Maintained:
  - Casual, friendly instructor voice
  - Direct address ("you", "we", "let's")
  - Demonstrative language ("See?", "Look here", "Check this out")
  - Encouraging tone ("can still grow", "nothing difficult")

✓ Visual References Translated:
  - "Click here" → clear UI instructions
  - "This line" → contextual references
  - "See?" → kept enthusiasm markers
  - Color references preserved (blue line, red line, yellow TP)

✓ Technical Accuracy:
  - Position Sizing formula explained correctly
  - RR ratio examples accurate (1:2, 1:3, 2:1)
  - Pip vs Point distinction maintained (1 pip = 10 points)
  - Broker examples preserved (Tickmill, XM, FBS)

✓ Context-Aware Choices:
  - "สมมุติว่า" → varied translations (Let's say, Suppose, For example)
  - "เห็นไหมครับ" → "See?" (kept energy)
  - "ตรงนี้" → contextual (here, at this level, this spot)
  - "ปุ๊บ" → "when" / "as soon as" (removed sound effects)
