TOPIC:
Support & Resistance - Part 2 of Price Action Teaching Series
This lesson teaches horizontal Support/Resistance concepts, price zones (not single lines), role reversal (S→R, R→S), multi-timeframe analysis, and combining S/R with candlestick patterns for trade decisions.

TEACHING TONE & STYLE:
- Casual, conversational, friendly instructor
- Heavy use of military metaphors (battlefield, army, walls, attack/defend)
- Interactive teaching style with questions
- Visual chart examples with live demonstration
- Use contractions in English: "we'll", "let's", "it's"
- Keep natural conversational flow

TRANSCRIPTION ERRORS DETECTED (AUTO-CORRECT):
1. "Player Action" / "Pry Action" / "ไพรแอคชั่น" → Price Action (3 instances)
2. "แนวลับ" → แนวรับ (Support) - Whisper transcribed wrong (~60 instances)
3. "สนามลบ" → สนามรบ (battlefield) - 1 instance

FOREX TERMINOLOGY (Top 15):
1. แนวรับ/แนวต้าน → Support/Resistance (127x total)
2. แท่งเทียน → Candlestick (27x)
3. โซนราคา → Price Zone (15x) - NOT single price line
4. ทะลุ → Break through / Breakout (40x)
5. เด้ง → Bounce (25x)
6. ทดสอบ → Test / Retest (18x)
7. Swing Point → Swing High/Low (5x) - KEEP AS IS
8. Pinbar → Pinbar (6x) - KEEP AS IS
9. แข็งแรง/แข็งแกร่ง → Strong (level tested multiple times, 12x)
10. ทำหน้าที่ → acts as / functions as / switches role to (22x)
11. ไทม์เฟรม → Timeframe (8x)
12. แนวนอน → Horizontal (6x)
13. กราฟ → Chart (15x)
14. เทรนด์ → Trend (7x)
15. Momentum → Momentum (2x)

MILITARY METAPHORS DETECTED (Major Theme):
- สนามรบ = Battlefield (market as war zone)
- กำแพง = Wall / Barrier (S/R as price walls, 15x)
- ทัพ = Army / Forces (buying/selling pressure, 8x)
- บุก = Attack / Push (price attacking level, 6x)
- ตั้งรับ = Defend / Hold (level defending, 4x)
- กำลัง = Forces / Strength (market forces)
- ทหาร = Soldiers (traders/participants)
- ด่าน = Checkpoint / Barrier (S/R level)

IDIOMS & METAPHORS:
- วิ่ง = "moves" / "runs" (price movement, 30x)
- ฝั่ง = "side" (bull/bear side, 43x)
- หักหัว = "reverses" / "turns back"
- ชน = "hits" / "touches" (price hitting level)
- ย้อน = "reverses" / "pulls back"
- ครองเกม = "dominates" / "controls" (which side wins)

PARTICLES TO REMOVE (777 total):
- ครับ: 214x → REMOVE ALL
- เนี่ย/เนี่ย: 225x → REMOVE ALL
- นะ: 159x → REMOVE ALL
- นะครับ: 117x → REMOVE ALL
- เลย: 62x → REMOVE ALL
Rule: Thai particles do NOT translate to English. Remove completely.

TEACHING STRUCTURE:
Segments 1-100: Introduction
- Price Action Part 2 introduction
- Review: Candlesticks from Part 1
- Introduce S/R as the key component

Segments 100-300: Core S/R Concepts
- Horizontal S/R concept (Type 1)
- Price zones vs single price lines
- Swing points identification
- Role reversal: Support ↔ Resistance
- Strength of levels (tested multiple times = stronger)

Segments 300-500: Multi-Timeframe Analysis
- Start with higher timeframe (Week/4H)
- Drill down to lower timeframe (1H)
- Historical S/R validation
- Zone drawing technique

Segments 500-700: Practical Chart Examples
- Real chart analysis
- Combining S/R with candlestick patterns
- Pinbar at S/R = high probability setup
- S/R as "focus points" for reading price action

Segments 700-830: Military Metaphor Extension
- Market = Battlefield between two cities
- S/R = City walls/barriers
- Price = Army attacking/defending
- Traders = Soldiers with varying strength
- Breakout = Wall destroyed, role reverses

SPECIAL TRANSLATION NOTES:
1. S/R Role Reversal: "ทำหน้าที่" = "acts as" / "switches to" (dynamic concept)
2. Price Zone emphasis: Always "zone" not "line" (repeated 15+ times)
3. Military metaphors: Keep natural (wall, army, attack) - don't over-translate
4. Testing levels: "ทดสอบ" = "test" or "retest" (contextual)
5. Breakout: "ทะลุ" = "break through" or "breakout" (both OK)
6. Bounce: "เด้ง" = "bounce" (simple, direct)
7. Chart references: "ตรงนี้" → "here", "อันนี้" → "this one"
8. Teaching questions: "เห็นไหมครับ" → "see?", "ถูกไหมครับ" → "right?"

CONTEXT AWARENESS REQUIRED:
- This is Part 2 of Price Action series (Part 1 covered Candlesticks)
- Students know candlestick basics (Pinbar, Engulfing, Doji, Momentum)
- Instructor builds on previous knowledge
- Heavy emphasis on "zones not lines" (repeated concept)
- Military metaphor is central teaching device (market = war)
- Role reversal concept is critical (S→R, R→S)
- Multi-timeframe approach is professional trading method

TRANSLATION APPROACH:
- Use context-aware translation (NOT segment-by-segment)
- Maintain casual teaching tone throughout
- Keep technical terms in English (Support, Resistance, Swing Point, Pinbar)
- Remove all Thai particles (777 instances)
- Translate military metaphors naturally (wall, army, attack, defend)
- Fix transcription errors automatically (แนวลับ → Support, etc.)
- Preserve teaching enthusiasm and question-based engagement
- Role reversal phrases: use "acts as" / "functions as" / "switches to"
