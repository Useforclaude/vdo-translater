FOREX TERMINOLOGY (Top 10):
1. เทรนด์ / แนวโน้ม → Trend (64x total)
2. Higher High → Higher High (18x) - KEEP AS IS
3. Higher Low → Higher Low (11x) - KEEP AS IS
4. แท่งเทียน → Candlestick (13x)

- วิ่ง = "moves" / "running" (price movement, NOT literal running)
- คลื่น = "waves" (price wave patterns)
- หักหัว = "reverses" / "turns" (price turning point)
- ยกตัว = "elevates" / "lifts up" (price elevation)
- พักตัว = "consolidates" / "rests" (consolidation phase)
- สูสี = "evenly matched" (if appears - battle metaphor)
