00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,780
In this lesson, we'll be talking about

2
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:05,599
waves, Wave Analysis.

3
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:08,480
After we've analyzed candlesticks quite a bit,

4
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:11,019
let's try looking at them as waves.

5
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:15,259
Candlesticks - multiple candlesticks combined together form a wave.

6
00:00:15,259 --> 00:00:20,239
First, let's get familiar with this.

7
00:00:20,239 --> 00:00:21,739
We'll see that we have

8
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:23,899
I'll draw three lines, three lines.

9
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:27,920
What are these? Let's take a closer look.

10
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:31,699
These three lines represent waves. They're candlesticks.

11
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:57,119
Candlesticks. Now I'll draw it for you like this.

12
00:00:57,119 --> 00:01:00,299
Alright.

13
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:01,679
It's about momentum. We're going to look at the psychology of candlesticks.

14
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:06,760
Of waves, which are candlesticks.

15
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:09,939
Candlesticks - multiple candlesticks combined together.

16
00:01:09,939 --> 00:01:14,280
We'll call this a rise. It's rising in a line, almost.

17
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:31,680
I'll only explain one side, which is when it hits resistance.

18
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:34,780
The reverse case, the explanation also applies to when it comes down and hits support, same thing.

19
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:41,760
Important resistance, important support.

20
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:44,159
Okay.

21
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:46,159
Now let's look at this wave.

22
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:48,260
The way price climbs might come in this pattern.

23
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:53,760
Like this.

24
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:56,159
And like this.

25
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:05,379
This is one pattern.

26
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:29,680
Now we'll see waves, or the pattern of groups of candlesticks combined to form a wave.

27
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:39,759
Three patterns running up to resistance.

28
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:44,479
Now what does this tell us?

29
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:46,840
Normally if we don't look at waves, we just look at candlesticks, we'll already know that this one

30
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,599
has momentum rising, and the momentum is gradually decreasing, see?

31
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:56,460
This one, from weak momentum, if we read the candlesticks,

32
00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:01,120
we might not read the whole bar. We might just read this part, saying

33
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:04,759
compared to this one, this one's momentum is decreasing. This one's momentum is increasing.

34
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:08,740
This one's momentum is relatively steady. But if we look at it combined as a wave

35
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:15,020
we can see it faster, easier, or get a bigger picture. We'll see it already just by looking at the rise. It already tells us.

36
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:22,879
When it comes to the momentum when hitting

37
00:03:23,759 --> 00:03:27,699
important resistance, which rise pattern do you think

38
00:03:28,979 --> 00:03:34,259
has the best chance of breaking through resistance?

39
00:03:35,099 --> 00:03:40,080
If there are only these three patterns, only three patterns like this,

40
00:03:42,099 --> 00:03:46,520
the one with the highest chance is this one.

41
00:03:47,319 --> 00:03:51,099
You'll see its momentum is very low at first, then gradually increases.

42
00:03:51,759 --> 00:03:56,560
It glides along like this, glides along the floor, then shoots up with increasing steepness, like in stocks they'd say the market maker is accumulating, preparing the position.

43
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:26,540
So this one will be number 1, meaning the momentum is quite strong going up.

44
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:31,459
This one's called exponential, curved like this, curving upward.

45
00:04:31,459 --> 00:04:36,000
The opposite going down would be like this obviously.

46
00:04:36,879 --> 00:04:38,819
Because it's relatively steady, it's linear, it's a straight line.

47
00:04:38,819 --> 00:04:41,699
When it keeps climbing, there's a chance it'll test the resistance and break through.

48
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:48,100
This one has less momentum than the others.

49
00:04:48,379 --> 00:04:50,220
Whether you look at waves or candlesticks,

50
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:53,100
you'll already see that the wave with this steepness

51
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:56,519
curves outward.

52
00:04:57,020 --> 00:04:58,360
The fact that it curves away from resistance already shows it doesn't have enough momentum to break through.

53
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:04,839
There's a higher chance it'll consolidate compared to these two waves.

54
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:13,040
There are 2 possibilities for this rise pattern.

55
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:17,420
It breaks through in one go.

56
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:20,199
It can make a candlestick break through resistance.

57
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:25,259
Or it might consolidate down a bit, consolidate lightly, then go back up.

58
00:05:25,259 --> 00:05:31,560
This one's the same, but because its momentum is steady,

59
00:05:33,219 --> 00:05:39,220
there's nothing breaking it, but when it hits resistance,

60
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:43,319
there might be a slight consolidation to accumulate momentum, then continue.

61
00:05:44,699 --> 00:05:53,079
In this case there's a chance of both - going straight through or consolidating. But this one,

62
00:05:54,019 --> 00:05:58,920
does it have a chance to go straight through? Yes, it does.

63
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:01,040
But the percentage is lower than this one.

64
00:06:01,539 --> 00:06:03,240
Because it's like driving a car, gradually pressing the accelerator more and more,

65
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:07,660
shifting up gears higher and higher,

66
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:10,139
increasing speed,

67
00:06:10,359 --> 00:06:12,660
you can break through the wall, punch through the wall.

68
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:16,600
This one is like driving steadily at 80.

69
00:06:17,139 --> 00:06:19,180
It just keeps going. If it encounters resistance, it'll need to pause a bit, then go.

70
00:06:29,159 --> 00:06:33,639
This one comes gradually, driving comfortably, slowly increasing,

71
00:06:34,359 --> 00:06:37,339
40, 60, 70, 80, 90, to over 100, 200, it has a chance to break straight through.

72
00:06:37,339 --> 00:06:43,060
Or it builds up then hits an obstacle, it might pause a bit to see what it is.

73
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:48,839
Coming in fast, then encountering resistance, might hesitate a bit.

74
00:06:49,139 --> 00:06:52,079
But with that speed,  even if you hit the brakes,

75
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:54,439
Try to imagine, you're driving, hit the brakes.

76
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:57,100
Driving fast, engine's roaring, hitting the barrier, speeding all the way,

77
00:06:57,100 --> 00:07:02,040
and touch the brakes, it won't stop. It'll just slow down a tiny bit.

78
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:05,699
The reaction is just a small pullback then it has to keep going

79
00:07:05,699 --> 00:07:08,600
following the momentum that's already there. Get it?

80
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:11,480
This one, it accelerated from far away then gradually hits the brakes.

81
00:07:11,799 --> 00:07:14,639
Reducing speed gradually.

82
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:16,019
Then hits an obstacle, a barrier, hits resistance,

83
00:07:16,419 --> 00:07:19,160
or hits a wall,

84
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:20,459
it's hard to get through.

85
00:07:21,459 --> 00:07:22,740
Like you need to walk up and see what it is first.

86
00:07:23,539 --> 00:07:25,600
Can't turn back because it still has some speed left or some momentum, but it's not that strong.

87
00:07:26,619 --> 00:07:32,800
To turn it around, if it only comes back this much and steps on the gas again, it's difficult. It might need to reverse much further back,

88
00:07:33,739 --> 00:07:41,399
then start building momentum from scratch again to charge through.

89
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:45,199
When it sets up far away, sort of like that.

90
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:50,160
In more technical or formal terms, price has come up a long way.

91
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:55,939
Those who bought are selling along the way near resistance, afraid it won't break through.

92
00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:00,879
So there's a decrease in momentum.

93
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:02,959
But here there's a strong price drive going up. In stocks they'd say they accumulated a lot, they want it through in one go.

94
00:08:03,619 --> 00:08:10,579
Similar concept. This one, price has stability.

95
00:08:10,579 --> 00:08:15,839
It travels like this, this pattern is linear, it goes up and consolidates a bit then continues up.

96
00:08:15,839 --> 00:08:21,560
Here we need to be careful. From looking at waves, looking at momentum going up,

97
00:08:21,859 --> 00:08:25,660
we come look at the candlesticks here.

98
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:27,259
Here the chance we'll see selling pressure candlesticks,

99
00:08:28,179 --> 00:08:31,279
or reversal candlesticks, whether we see one clear candlestick

100
00:08:31,279 --> 00:08:34,240
or multiple candlesticks, and we combine them into one

101
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:51,539
selling pressure pattern. Combining candlesticks into this pattern is less likely than this one.

102
00:08:52,259 --> 00:08:57,679
Because it's such large candlesticks. The precision as it builds up, combining large candlesticks to become this pattern,

103
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:03,960
it's almost impossible. But small candlesticks combined into this, it's more likely.

104
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:12,059
So this becomes number one in terms of momentum.

105
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:15,840
This is number 2, and number 3. The reverse applies for support.

106
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:21,159
Price running down, touching support, testing support,

107
00:09:21,159 --> 00:09:24,299
it's under the same conditions.

108
00:09:24,299 --> 00:09:27,120
When reading waves in Price Action, when we look at the momentum of price movement,

109
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:33,100
besides reading candlesticks, we read waves together.

110
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:35,919
Now waves, besides

111
00:09:35,919 --> 00:09:36,879
what I'll call the shapes,

112
00:09:36,879 --> 00:09:40,279
straight line, saturation curve,

113
00:09:40,279 --> 00:09:42,899
curved at the end like this,

114
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,700
and exponential curve, curved at the beginning then shooting up,

115
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:48,720
like this. This one is a straight line, linear.

116
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,820
There's another way to analyze

117
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:54,440
waves

118
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:55,019
in another way. We've analyzed by shape, now

119
00:09:56,500 --> 00:10:00,620
we analyze in another way. Let's continue

120
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:03,000
analyzing. This is another wave analysis method

121
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,940
following from earlier. Earlier we had three patterns like this.

122
00:10:06,259 --> 00:10:25,000
Instead of focusing on the wave shape like this,

123
00:10:25,979 --> 00:10:33,340
I'll draw them all as straight lines, no curves, all straight lines.

124
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:39,240
But this analyzes the momentum of price, the force in pushing it up or down,

125
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:45,940
either way, depending on what the trend is.

126
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:49,000
There'll be three types. Simply put, it's looking at the angle.

127
00:10:49,259 --> 00:10:53,059
We measure this one as horizontal,

128
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:56,139
as the vertical axis. If we think of it as a straight axis,

129
00:10:56,139 --> 00:11:02,340
if it's straight like this, it's 90 degrees.

130
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:05,139
This one I'll say is about 75 degrees, something like that.

131
00:11:05,659 --> 00:11:11,159
This one might be around 60, this one maybe 45, like this.

132
00:11:11,159 --> 00:11:14,679
Look at the degrees, the angle here.

133
00:11:14,679 --> 00:11:16,539
The angle here tells us about the wave's momentum,

134
00:11:18,699 --> 00:11:26,899
whether it's strong or weak as it travels.

135
00:11:26,899 --> 00:11:32,500
It'll leave traces for us. In this case, going up like this, the price chart rises

136
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:41,059
as an uptrend. Look at this picture. Going up like this, does it have a chance to fall when it reaches here? This is resistance.

137
00:11:41,059 --> 00:12:02,419
Simply put, it can consolidate, and it might have a chance to break through resistance.

138
00:12:02,419 --> 00:12:06,019
So it consolidates down this much.

139
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:10,080
Now does this pattern have a higher chance of falling than the first one?

140
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:15,340
Yes, a higher chance of consolidating. Because see how it's tilted,

141
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:19,139
using the word "steepness." Low steepness, high steepness, right? High steepness is like climbing a mountain. This one has lower steepness, climbing less.

142
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:31,980
It's like price can keep going, but this pattern still has a chance to continue.

143
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:37,039
If considered relatively stable,

144
00:12:37,039 --> 00:12:41,279
it might consolidate. Instead of consolidating as much as the previous one, it might consolidate more.

145
00:12:41,899 --> 00:12:45,139
It might go slowly.

146
00:12:47,879 --> 00:12:49,399
But this pattern is interesting. The steepness compared to the previous 2

147
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:55,100
is low. What do we call it?

148
00:12:56,159 --> 00:12:58,980
This angle, we look at the angle.

149
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:02,240
This one is much lower than the others. It's flat.

150
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:07,860
Does it have a chance to continue? Yes, it has a chance.

151
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:12,399
It doesn't mean it can't go. We need to understand this as a principle to know.

152
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:18,139
We have to use many things together. We don't use just one thing

153
00:13:18,139 --> 00:13:21,440
and it'll be exactly right, spot on. It's not like that.

154
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:24,799
We have to take principle or theory A plus B plus C and combine them to analyze.

155
00:13:24,799 --> 00:13:32,179
In this case, it's the same - it has a much higher chance of falling. It has a higher chance of going down,

156
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:40,000
and might even have a chance of changing trend. Like it's losing momentum if we combine the factors.

157
00:13:40,879 --> 00:13:47,820
It's like right now when it's rising, there's pressure pushing down.

158
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:54,320
Pushing, pushing down, those forces can't fight this one at all.

159
00:13:56,860 --> 00:14:00,379
It pushed up to this steepness. But this one, it's like pressure along the way.

160
00:14:00,379 --> 00:14:05,460
See? This line, what do we call it, the steepness of the chart.

161
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:11,139
It shows this side has decent momentum, but if it's this pattern, it's pushing, pushing, pushing down.

162
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:23,279
Meaning there's downward pressure here more than these two patterns, so price can't actually support itself and push up with steepness. So it gradually

163
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:36,259
tilts out, less steep. This one has strong pressure pushing strongly, this one pushes less. So it's like fighting and can't hold, so it gradually tilts down. The price axis gradually tilts down, so it has a chance, psychologically speaking, that it

164
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:55,700
can't continue. We combine it with something like this.

165
00:14:57,060 --> 00:15:02,559
For example, we might look, we analyze it rising first.

166
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:07,759
We can combine it with candlesticks too, depends on you.

167
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:12,419
Rising candlesticks in this pattern, sometimes what we see, it's often a candlestick that

168
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,440
has momentum that's steep like this going up.

169
00:15:17,639 --> 00:15:22,019
This one's similar.

170
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:25,700
There'll be a mix of small and large candlesticks here and there.

171
00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:33,940
But we'll see it's unlikely to be a candlestick pattern like this.

172
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:55,679
Down. So let's analyze together.

173
00:15:56,479 --> 00:16:03,460
This is another principle to use and look at.

174
00:16:04,559 --> 00:16:08,200
This part is another pattern, it's a psychological pattern

175
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:13,360
that's quite effective.

176
00:16:14,459 --> 00:16:19,480
Meaning, this is a downtrend, downtrend. Going down, down, down.

177
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:26,759
When it's done going down, it goes up. It goes up like normal, going up.

178
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:31,419
But when you look at it going down, the difference starts here.

179
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:36,940
It goes up, up more than it went down.

180
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:41,720
It has upward momentum, buying pressure coming in.

181
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:44,860
But when it reaches this point, it's in the resistance zone, so it has to test and consolidate down.

182
00:16:49,179 --> 00:16:55,659
Now when it consolidates, it's consolidating gradually down over time.

183
00:16:56,439 --> 00:17:06,480
When it's going up, see? This range

184
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:11,079
is narrow, meaning it takes less time. If these candlesticks are

185
00:17:11,079 --> 00:17:15,220
day candlesticks, what's this, this might be just about 4 days.

186
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:22,059
Rising 4 days to reach this height. But when falling, it might

187
00:17:22,059 --> 00:17:26,920
take about 2 weeks. It takes about 2 weeks to gradually fall as day candlesticks, 2 weeks.

188
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:32,700
But when it comes near support, there's buying pressure supporting it.

189
00:17:33,579 --> 00:17:38,460
The green side comes in to defend, coming up like this candlestick.

190
00:17:39,619 --> 00:17:43,400
Saying "like this candlestick" means two cases - we see it as one candlestick

191
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:48,079
or it's some pattern, but when we

192
00:17:48,079 --> 00:17:52,240
use the technique of combining candlesticks, it becomes a strong upward push

193
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:56,240
like this. So it has a chance to shoot up like this.

194
00:17:56,240 --> 00:18:01,299
If we call it, it's down slow, up fast.

195
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:09,140
This pattern, like this. Up fast, down slow.

196
00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:14,299
You ask, up fast down slow, so why does it have to go up?

197
00:18:15,059 --> 00:18:17,599
Why doesn't it go down? If following psychology, here it's driving up with strong upward momentum.

198
00:18:17,879 --> 00:18:26,059
But when falling it won't easily fall. If it easily fell it would fall like this. But it won't. It's stubborn. Going back to reading charts like watching movies,

199
00:18:27,079 --> 00:18:38,599
the other side pushes down, it defends.

200
00:18:39,839 --> 00:18:43,460
It defends, defends, defends, fights to the very end. They attack but can't reach the final line.

201
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:51,259
Defending, defending, defending, using a lot of time to defend.

202
00:18:51,259 --> 00:18:53,960
Until there's momentum coming in, there's supporting momentum coming in.

203
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:58,200
This side might be tired, because they've been fighting for many days.

204
00:18:59,099 --> 00:19:02,019
Right? Fighting for a long time, for a month or many days.

205
00:19:02,019 --> 00:19:05,900
Fighting for a moment, pushes up, then gets pushed back down.

206
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:10,160
Because here is the defense line of the other side. They're in here, they push back.

207
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:13,599
But they can't push it all the way back like this.

208
00:19:13,599 --> 00:19:17,140
They can't win at all. It gradually pulls back. This side, okay,

209
00:19:17,559 --> 00:19:21,480
might get pushed back into their own zone more and more.

210
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:25,039
But in the end when it reaches here, there are signs of momentum coming in.

211
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:28,759
They have a chance to push up because the soldiers on this side, don't forget they've been pushing for this long.

212
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:33,080
What's important is that momentum comes in here. Don't forget, it's not just because of seeing this much pattern...

213
00:19:36,519 --> 00:19:59,900
But mostly if we see a pattern like this, there's about a 70-80% chance it'll be like this already.

214
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:05,400
Using the word "chance of occurring" is already high.  Now let's look at the next case.

215
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:12,460
Here's resistance. Price rises like this, then falls.

216
00:20:13,099 --> 00:20:21,220
Then price rises again like this.

217
00:20:22,759 --> 00:20:24,220
I'll speak broadly first, haven't gone into specific entry points yet. But I mean when we analyze waves, this one going up like this.

218
00:20:27,699 --> 00:20:38,640
Going up, up, up, up, then it falls and consolidates. Going up again,

219
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:53,420
roughly like this.

220
00:21:05,799 --> 00:21:06,680
Before,

221
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:08,619
if we

222
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:09,160
think we see this pattern looks good, say we see this wave looks good, so we went long here.

223
00:21:10,599 --> 00:21:15,279
Long going up, hits resistance, doesn't break through, comes down. Comes down then goes back up.

224
00:21:15,939 --> 00:21:22,720
Still holding. Holding this order, entered on this wave, because we saw the pattern looks good, has momentum, should break through, so we went long.

225
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:31,240
It came down then goes back up. But this time round two when it goes up, it has this shape.

226
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:36,799
From having gone long, it becomes a point for us to consider when it hits resistance.

227
00:21:39,359 --> 00:21:44,059
It might not make it this round, it might fall more than here.

228
00:21:45,759 --> 00:21:49,759
So what do we do? We should take profit.

229
00:21:50,439 --> 00:21:52,339
Sell out.

230
00:21:54,039 --> 00:21:55,180
This is the consideration in this case where we went long or if we come to go long here, we can go long.

231
00:21:56,119 --> 00:22:01,099
Now in the case where we didn't go long, we didn't go long so what do we do? Just sit and watch.

232
00:22:01,099 --> 00:22:14,140
This rises strong, hits resistance, don't dare do anything. It comes with strength. Simply put, don't dare go long this round. Want to try to catch a sell

233
00:22:14,599 --> 00:22:23,920
here, don't dare sell. It comes with strength, see?

234
00:22:24,339 --> 00:22:26,420
Momentum comes strong.

235
00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:27,640
Then it consolidates.

236
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:29,440
But when we see the second pattern,

237
00:22:31,099 --> 00:22:32,799
and if we combine candlesticks or there are signals,

238
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:38,119
signals coming out in the next candlestick,

239
00:22:40,619 --> 00:22:43,039
small ones,

240
00:22:43,659 --> 00:22:44,700
this candlestick combined has to definitely be selling pressure.

241
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:48,140
We can

242
00:22:49,819 --> 00:22:51,079
sell.

243
00:22:52,119 --> 00:22:52,819
Sell down, profit going short from resistance with this wave pattern.

244
00:22:54,659 --> 00:23:01,599
Compared to selling this wave, it's riskier.

245
00:23:01,939 --> 00:23:06,059
I drew it so we see it going down, but actually it might only fall this much then continue. If we sold, we'd be stopped out.

246
00:23:06,059 --> 00:23:12,880
In this case it's safer if we see this wave pattern.

247
00:23:13,259 --> 00:23:23,900
This escapes resistance. Two angles, see?

248
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:29,079
This one's angle is lower. This one shows lots of momentum.

249
00:23:29,079 --> 00:23:41,519
This one's angle is lower, so it can't

250
00:23:41,519 --> 00:23:46,200
keep rising straight like this. There's resistance pressure from the other side pushing down,

251
00:23:46,259 --> 00:23:51,960
if this is buying pressure, selling pressure is also there in this zone, this space.

252
00:23:52,479 --> 00:23:57,220
Making price have to spread out sideways, creating a lower angle, reduced angle.

253
00:23:57,220 --> 00:24:03,759
Then when we look comparing it with the candlesticks we've learned,

254
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:07,720
see how the bodies get shorter, shorter, shorter, momentum decreases.

255
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:11,519
At this point.

256
00:24:12,579 --> 00:24:15,059
So using the word "probability" that price will consolidate down,

257
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:18,779
here there's a higher possibility,

258
00:24:20,119 --> 00:24:23,500
over half. So we can try to decide to open an order

259
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:26,960
to sell. And stop loss we place above.

260
00:24:27,899 --> 00:24:31,480
Something like that. The reason I explain is so you know why.

261
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:39,980
Know it to enter orders and exit at appropriate points.

262
00:24:40,399 --> 00:24:44,200
Not exit points but entry points, entry points where we dare to risk entering,

263
00:24:47,659 --> 00:24:52,599
with more safety.

264
00:24:52,819 --> 00:24:55,640
Not anyone. This one is to know. If it's downtrend

265
00:24:56,599 --> 00:25:02,720
downtrend, look for timing when price bounces up strongly, then

266
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:08,460
comes back down testing, taking more time than going up.

267
00:25:09,199 --> 00:25:16,799
There's a chance it'll continue up.

268
00:25:17,599 --> 00:25:18,980
The reverse when it's going up testing resistance,

269
00:25:20,899 --> 00:25:23,440
then gets pushed down strongly,

270
00:25:23,959 --> 00:25:25,660
then will go up to test again,

271
00:25:26,179 --> 00:25:27,680
but looks like it doesn't have momentum like this.

272
00:25:28,419 --> 00:25:30,160
There's a chance it won't break through

273
00:25:30,859 --> 00:25:32,519
and will fall like this.

274
00:25:32,959 --> 00:25:36,380
So it's one pattern to watch.

275
00:25:37,479 --> 00:25:39,779
We can look at the opposite first.

276
00:25:40,099 --> 00:25:41,680
Let's look.

277
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:46,079
Look at this one.

278
00:25:50,259 --> 00:25:51,359
Look at this one.

279
00:25:52,839 --> 00:25:55,859
Like EU I've drawn already.

280
00:25:56,339 --> 00:26:01,160
You'll see this zone,

281
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:04,279
these two lines, it'll be a zone of

282
00:26:05,339 --> 00:26:07,799
what? Of resistance.

283
00:26:09,339 --> 00:26:13,299
And look when price drives up, see? Here when it goes up, very steep.

284
00:26:14,319 --> 00:26:19,019
Look at the angle. Steep. And here gradually tilts out.

285
00:26:19,439 --> 00:26:23,519
And this one tilts out even more, see? In the end what happens?

286
00:26:23,740 --> 00:26:27,519
This is all indicator of selling pressure at resistance.

287
00:26:33,459 --> 00:26:42,880
But the selling pressure when it goes up here, it goes up straight. It goes up strong. If you look at the pattern of the rise, see that here it's an exponential pattern.

288
00:26:44,099 --> 00:27:01,759
If you're confused, let me outline the shape for you. It's roughly like this. It runs up like this, this wave, see?

289
00:27:02,559 --> 00:27:07,920
Shows momentum. It shoots strong, right? But even with that much momentum it still doesn't break through.

290
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:12,859
But with that much force, that much momentum, the candlesticks here,

291
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:16,019
the candlesticks didn't get shorter either. If we look at candlesticks together, see they have upward momentum.

292
00:27:16,019 --> 00:27:22,420
If you look at the wave pattern, it curves up as exponential, meaning accelerating with force going up.

293
00:27:23,319 --> 00:27:26,740
You ask, will it actually break through? It did break through for a bit, which is here.

294
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:30,259
If you say they wanted it through, they got it through already.

295
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,420
But it could only continue this much.

296
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:38,480
They might've unloaded their positions here already. See? Then it drops in red candlesticks consecutively, no green at all.

297
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:56,720
So it falls. But it's not falling much because momentum is still hanging. Get it?

298
00:27:58,040 --> 00:28:03,579
The original resistance line, this one broke through with

299
00:28:03,579 --> 00:28:08,140
momentum, so it broke through, see? It penetrated but after penetrating

300
00:28:08,140 --> 00:28:11,099
some people went long following it, thinking it broke so it'll continue.

301
00:28:11,099 --> 00:28:14,940
It consolidates down. Now let's talk about how to

302
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:20,000
enter the structure, the way I advertised.

303
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:25,920
For those who came to learn, I teach kids, it's easy to remember.

304
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:30,500
And they can trade their way. We're bigger, we're adults.

305
00:28:30,939 --> 00:28:35,440
How do we trade? Well, let's gradually look at that part.

306
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:44,380
This wave tilts, so it only went up this much then it fell. Now let's look at the third round, see?  Round three tilts even more than before.

307
00:28:44,740 --> 00:28:49,039
Even less than before. This is falling to support level, same thing. See?

308
00:28:50,639 --> 00:28:58,880
This angle with this angle, this angle is less, see? Shows when going up, at this zone it went up fairly steeply, then it fell.

309
00:28:59,739 --> 00:29:07,379
Fell back and came up multiple candlesticks, fell three candlesticks. But this one, see, there's fighting in price. This one if we talk about it we'll repeat the candlestick stuff. We're looking at waves.

310
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:10,319
Going up, it went up then tilted, it lost

311
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:15,839
energy to keep rising. It was shown that the opposite side

312
00:29:15,839 --> 00:29:21,859
is pushing down here. If it didn't, it would've pushed

313
00:29:21,859 --> 00:29:37,359
straight up. But it got stuck, had to spread sideways like this. With that angle,

314
00:29:37,799 --> 00:29:43,740
that's definitely support. Because it creates steepness at three levels coming down.

315
00:29:44,339 --> 00:29:48,680
The first one is like this, fairly steep, which is the second,

316
00:29:49,339 --> 00:29:51,819
it starts tilting out, and the third one, tilts out even more.

317
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:54,400
It's like it's about to topple over.

318
00:29:54,400 --> 00:30:04,599
But here is the dam gate holding back water, water pressure about to burst from this side.

319
00:30:05,879 --> 00:30:10,559
It gradually tilts, tilts out, then it falls.

320
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:13,200
When it falls what happens? The wave bursts through.

321
00:30:13,999 --> 00:30:17,039
Can't hold the water in the dam, it pours down.

322
00:30:17,039 --> 00:30:19,480
Sort of like that pattern.

323
00:30:20,739 --> 00:30:23,140
So we see the picture as we see it.

324
00:30:23,140 --> 00:30:26,440
But when it pours down, see what happens?

325
00:30:27,059 --> 00:30:29,119
What happens? Look at the wave pattern.

326
00:30:32,519 --> 00:30:33,779
Too many lines, getting confused.

327
00:30:36,659 --> 00:30:40,720
Let me clear it and redo it.

328
00:30:52,259 --> 00:30:53,740
Let's just leave this much.

329
00:30:59,639 --> 00:31:02,359
Like this. Look at the falling wave pattern, how does it fall?

330
00:31:03,179 --> 00:31:04,839
It falls as saturation.

331
00:31:05,659 --> 00:31:08,079
Drops down strongly then curves outward.

332
00:31:08,979 --> 00:31:11,099
When it's about to hit support.

333
00:31:12,239 --> 00:31:14,519
Support, see? Support is here.

334
00:31:14,939 --> 00:31:19,440
The support zone. Then what happens? The pattern is this weak wave like this, see?

335
00:31:20,019 --> 00:31:23,539
The momentum of the candlesticks corresponds with the wave pattern.

336
00:31:24,119 --> 00:31:27,779
If it shot up strongly like this, just shot up,

337
00:31:30,059 --> 00:31:33,819
shooting up, remember the pattern we talked about earlier?

338
00:31:33,819 --> 00:31:40,460
It fell then rose quickly, then fell slower than before.

339
00:31:41,559 --> 00:31:55,180
It took more time than rising. And here it's the same. Look, it fell then rose sharply. Rose sharply, see? But when it falls again what happens?

340
00:32:00,239 --> 00:32:07,039
It went up like this, came down like this, came down like this, then fell another round, it fell like this.

341
00:32:08,079 --> 00:32:15,599
See? Like this. If we mark the tops we'll get this steepness. So

342
00:32:15,599 --> 00:32:21,380
it creates a break, penetrating through like this. Simply put, it rose quickly

343
00:32:21,380 --> 00:32:24,579
but when falling doesn't want to fall. This zone doesn't want to fall.

344
00:32:25,799 --> 00:32:28,859
If we go back to candlesticks, you should already know the reason.

345
00:32:28,859 --> 00:32:31,460
With this momentum here, this candlestick that's the major candle controlling,

346
00:32:32,379 --> 00:32:34,440
they're controlling here. It can't fall, so

347
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:38,380
candlesticks try to go down, go down, go down. In the end

348
00:32:38,380 --> 00:32:43,720
they get pushed back up because the bulls are piling up here, push out, successfully.

349
00:32:46,599 --> 00:32:52,880
Get it? It's easy if you understand waves and patterns to watch. It makes it easier for us to analyze.

350
00:32:54,539 --> 00:32:59,140
From not having to sit and look at candlesticks one by one

351
00:32:59,140 --> 00:33:01,000
like when we learned candlesticks.

352
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:05,140
Whether candlesticks rise a lot, rise a little, have strength to fight or not,

353
00:33:05,140 --> 00:33:07,019
lots of soldiers or not, and so on.

354
00:33:07,319 --> 00:33:10,539
If we look at it as waves we'll see the picture faster.

355
00:33:10,539 --> 00:33:12,640
And analyze accordingly,

356
00:33:14,220 --> 00:33:18,960
that the momentum is retreating, is decreasing. When it drops,

357
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:24,359
it dropped down strongly, then it broke through support downward, then gradually

358
00:33:24,359 --> 00:33:31,359
consolidates, curves out, touches support, shoots up. But when falling it's like it doesn't want to fall.

359
00:33:31,359 --> 00:33:39,940
Like this. There's a chance it'll continue. See? It continues. It consolidates.

360
00:33:42,259 --> 00:33:45,339
Then keeps going following its pattern.

361
00:33:48,740 --> 00:33:53,839
If we look at a new set, it'll be the same again.

362
00:34:03,759 --> 00:34:09,179
It shows price rising. This one rises straight like this, see?

363
00:34:09,940 --> 00:34:15,519
This one rises the same, then curves, see? Here this zone, these two lines are still the

364
00:34:15,519 --> 00:34:16,300
zone of what?

365
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:27,019
Resistance. This one rises straight, this one rises straight.

366
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:30,300
In the third round, curves out. Shows losing

367
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:39,559
and if we look at waves, see, if we just looked at candlesticks, we might not see short candlesticks

368
00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:44,800
like this. We might not see this pattern.

369
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:49,480
But we see it happening. Normally it's not this pattern.

370
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:55,579
But it consolidates up, consolidates up, and looking overall it becomes this pattern anyway.

371
00:34:55,579 --> 00:35:00,780
See how it can happen? This pattern can happen from any specific candlestick pattern,

372
00:35:00,780 --> 00:35:05,800
or it's the wave pattern that when you look overall

373
00:35:08,020 --> 00:35:12,619
is the saturation wave pattern that curves like this.

374
00:35:12,619 --> 00:35:16,059
Shows price is losing momentum. Then in the end what happens?

375
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:24,099
In the end it comes down. It doesn't continue. See? It fell then went sideways.

376
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:31,199
This is EU's habit already. Besides analyzing waves, analyzing candlesticks and all,

377
00:35:31,199 --> 00:35:35,739
we have to look at another thing that's essential - don't forget to look at the currency pair's characteristics.

378
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:38,139
Each pair has characteristics that

379
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:40,980
have unique traits, you have to go study it yourself.

380
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:44,780
But these principles or theories can be used with all currency pairs,

381
00:35:44,780 --> 00:35:45,860
all timeframes already.

382
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:49,780
For it to be more precise it should be timeframes

383
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:51,519
that are smaller or

384
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:54,639
hourly or whatever,

385
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:57,280
smaller,

386
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:01,340
smaller meaning from 1 hour and up.

387
00:36:01,340 --> 00:36:08,539
H1 and up. If it's small like 1 minute or 5 minutes, these might be too small and might be

388
00:36:09,420 --> 00:36:14,820
confusing to analyze. Look like this. See?

389
00:36:15,059 --> 00:36:20,159
It lost momentum so it fell. Don't see it going up at all, it just kept falling, see?

390
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:27,139
It went through here. Now let's look at another pattern, which is

391
00:36:27,139 --> 00:36:34,579
triangles. Those who trade should already know triangles well.

392
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:45,400
If looking at this picture, is there a triangle? Let me draw a new one instead.

393
00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:53,579
Okay, next case. It'll be about sideways.

394
00:36:53,579 --> 00:36:56,960
Sideways means the chart isn't going up or down, it might be in a box.

395
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:58,980
The green line is resistance.

396
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:01,539
The green line is support.

397
00:37:01,539 --> 00:37:06,280
The pattern of sideways, normally speaking,

398
00:37:06,579 --> 00:37:09,699
what's abnormal, I don't know what's abnormal. Let's talk about what's normal.

399
00:37:10,220 --> 00:37:13,019
It'll be just these three patterns.

400
00:37:13,019 --> 00:37:17,440
Meaning hitting resistance and running in a box.

401
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:22,760
Running in a box. Let me zoom in a bit to make this picture better.

402
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:30,420
So it's running in a box, roughly

403
00:37:32,420 --> 00:37:37,519
like type one. It'll be in a box like this.

404
00:37:38,740 --> 00:37:43,360
Type two, it's in a box the same,

405
00:37:43,559 --> 00:37:50,579
but it doesn't go all the way. Type one goes all the way.

406
00:37:51,740 --> 00:37:54,159
Type one when it swings, it creates support and resistance, right?

407
00:37:57,640 --> 00:38:12,860
Now it can still run to support and resistance in between. That's type one.

408
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:21,099
There's space created. There's a gap created. It doesn't reach. This one reaches. Type 1. Type 2 doesn't reach.

409
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:29,860
If you look carefully at this pattern, it's somewhat familiar, you might've seen it but might not have noticed.

410
00:38:29,860 --> 00:38:38,820
It's called a triangle. Type 3, it makes lows, makes highs,

411
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:43,860
but when coming down doesn't reach, doesn't reach

412
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:49,280
the original support it made.

413
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:53,380
But it comes back, transforming into a triangle.

414
00:38:53,380 --> 00:38:56,079
It pushes up again, hey reaches here.

415
00:38:56,079 --> 00:38:58,960
If we just look at this it's like it'll be a triangle, but it's not.

416
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:02,940
So here we can't decide yet.

417
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:07,880
But when it comes down again, it comes down to this support or lower than this,

418
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:16,360
it's not a trend anymore because if it's a trend it can't make a lower low than the previous low from what we've learned in Dow Theory.

419
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:18,500
Then it swings back up like this.

420
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:23,059
If it broke through, it might be a new downtrend,

421
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:27,659
meaning it made a lower high than the previous high. But it didn't go lower. It pushed back up like this.

422
00:39:27,659 --> 00:39:32,199
This one's called sideways. This one's called a widening triangle, like this.

423
00:39:32,579 --> 00:39:37,659
If it's sideways, there are about three patterns like this. Let's go look at real charts.

424
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:46,019
To know first that this is sideways. Now how do we analyze sideways?

425
00:39:46,019 --> 00:39:49,420
Or the principles of trading sideways, how do we trade it?

426
00:39:51,420 --> 00:40:01,940
This is an interesting sideways. I use the word "interesting."

427
00:40:01,940 --> 00:40:08,659
Actually all three types work. Like type 1, the normal way of trading would be

428
00:40:12,820 --> 00:40:18,000
to trade highs and lows. Actually for sideways, if it were me I wouldn't really trade it.

429
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:20,840
But this is just the principles. In case some people like it.

430
00:40:22,700 --> 00:40:26,800
You ask is it difficult? It's not too difficult, not too easy either.

431
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:30,940
Not difficult is if you know it's a sideways box like this, just catch sells,

432
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:35,599
catch buys, that's it.

433
00:40:36,860 --> 00:40:37,559
But what's difficult

434
00:40:39,019 --> 00:40:43,159
is knowing whether it'll be in a box or not, whether it'll be sideways like this?

435
00:40:44,059 --> 00:40:56,820
Does it have a chance to break out? It might be like this, comes here, falls here. Say you bought, then thinking you'll sell here, take profit here, it might go up

436
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:06,579
then fall like this. Right? So sideways is something where if I'm not confident I won't trade.

437
00:41:07,539 --> 00:41:13,519
Same thing, say this pattern happens. You sell, about to sell here,

438
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:16,599
it might only fall this much then run as a trend. Could happen.

439
00:41:17,700 --> 00:41:22,519
So it's difficult. It's difficult in not knowing.

440
00:41:22,519 --> 00:41:26,880
It's easy, like easy is if you know, then it's easy.

441
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:30,840
So what now? Nothing. For me I won't trade it.

442
00:41:31,140 --> 00:41:37,159
But I'm telling you the principle of trading is that once we can identify the position where it's making sideways highs and lows,

443
00:41:37,159 --> 00:41:39,500
swing highs swing lows, repeated 2 times already,

444
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:47,679
top first, top second, top 2. Bottom 2 is here.

445
00:41:47,679 --> 00:41:51,960
Here is the next point to trade buy and sell following support and resistance.

446
00:41:52,900 --> 00:42:00,539
That's it. As for another type, type 2 is the triangle pattern.

447
00:42:01,260 --> 00:42:08,000
This one's kind of interesting. Triangles. Analyzing triangles.

448
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:15,420
Because it'll be, price will be like this, sideways.

449
00:42:16,460 --> 00:42:20,880
Generally speaking, safe triangle trading is trading when it breaks out of the triangle.

450
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:28,719
Whether it breaks through the top or bottom. Because there'll be criteria that if a triangle breaks

451
00:42:29,780 --> 00:42:39,739
whichever way it goes, it'll go about the distance of, approximately the height of roughly

452
00:42:39,739 --> 00:42:43,260
this is called the base. This is the peak of the triangle. Here is the base.

453
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:49,059
It'll get approximately the same height or distance.

454
00:42:52,360 --> 00:42:57,780
For safety you have to trade the break. When it breaks up, it means you know it'll go up.

455
00:42:59,039 --> 00:43:05,099
But for the safest triangle break trading, some people might break and trade immediately.

456
00:43:05,099 --> 00:43:08,420
Might break and go long immediately. Now there's a chance it could be a fake break.

457
00:43:09,780 --> 00:43:27,760
A safer method for trading is to let it break. But when it breaks, it breaks about

458
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:34,619
the same distance as the base. Then wait for it to come

459
00:43:34,619 --> 00:43:41,320
back, then try selling following it. Or if you're still scared it'll trick you again,

460
00:43:41,700 --> 00:43:57,739
if you buy here then it falls again, something like that, well depends. But if you see it break,

461
00:44:00,120 --> 00:44:07,599
pullback clearly, now not sure if it'll continue down or will it really go back up,

462
00:44:07,599 --> 00:44:09,280
will it trick here? Simply put, this peak,

463
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:16,079
use the method of setting a pending order. Here would be a buy stop.

464
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:22,820
Writing is hard with a mouse. Buy stop, let's say.

465
00:44:23,820 --> 00:44:31,579
When price comes back up and touches, it'll continue in a distance roughly equal to the base width.

466
00:44:32,059 --> 00:44:37,059
If it breaks down it's the same, set a sell stop here, going down.

467
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:43,239
So choose how to trade. How you want to trade triangles,

468
00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:46,860
how to trade sideways in triangle form.

469
00:44:49,220 --> 00:44:50,820
There's still a way to analyze it.

470
00:44:50,820 --> 00:44:54,119
Instead of just analyzing and trading, some people don't want to analyze.

471
00:44:54,119 --> 00:44:58,139
Can we know which way it'll go? Something like that?

472
00:44:58,740 --> 00:45:00,119
There is a method.

473
00:45:00,119 --> 00:45:02,059
Method 1 is the simple method.

474
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:08,019
Simple is before it becomes sideways, it has to be a trend first.

475
00:45:08,539 --> 00:45:09,880
Say it's an uptrend,

476
00:45:09,880 --> 00:45:39,860
then it slowly...

477
00:45:40,180 --> 00:45:43,659
It doesn't have... Simply put it's just a triangle.

478
00:45:43,659 --> 00:45:48,280
It's sideways. The question is, the simple trading method is

479
00:45:49,260 --> 00:45:52,199
trade following its original trend. Simply put it's just tired.

480
00:45:52,199 --> 00:45:56,980
It's tired from climbing, so it rests. It climbed the mountain and found a rest stop midway,

481
00:45:56,980 --> 00:45:59,079
so it rests, that's all. Then it'll continue.

482
00:46:00,019 --> 00:46:09,320
Don't have to think too much. This is the simple thinking method. Trade following the trend, the same. Downtrend is the same. That's it.

483
00:46:11,380 --> 00:46:18,679
It'll go following its original trend. This is simple thinking. Trade following trend. Simple analysis. Want to

484
00:46:19,640 --> 00:46:23,019
analyze with more principles than this? Some people say, too easy?

485
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:25,300
Sure, if you like difficult, it's fine.

486
00:46:26,620 --> 00:46:28,780
It's not difficult. But there are more principles than this.

487
00:46:28,780 --> 00:46:31,500
There are more principles to add. Looks better.

488
00:46:31,980 --> 00:46:37,119
Like this. Which we can analyze in 2 ways, 2 types.

489
00:46:37,119 --> 00:46:39,659
I'll use a case where it's already running up.

490
00:46:43,460 --> 00:46:46,199
Running up or down I don't know. Let's say it's a pattern like this.

491
00:46:46,199 --> 00:46:50,219
Sideways in a box, and we draw lines around its swing.

492
00:46:50,219 --> 00:46:54,920
Connecting lines to form a triangle. So it's a triangle.

493
00:46:55,519 --> 00:47:00,280
In this case, method one, we analyze from the points where we connect the swing points.

494
00:47:01,820 --> 00:47:03,840
Here. The swing points in various places.

495
00:47:05,080 --> 00:47:07,760
Swing up, swing down, swing up,

496
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:11,079
but when swinging up here, see? Here's the trendline.

497
00:47:11,600 --> 00:47:15,119
There's a gap, there's space going up, it doesn't reach.

498
00:47:15,119 --> 00:47:19,480
It's like it wants to move here,

499
00:47:19,480 --> 00:47:23,559
but something came and pushed it down here,

500
00:47:24,019 --> 00:47:25,280
making the momentum not reach.

501
00:47:27,160 --> 00:47:31,340
So there's a chance the triangle will be broken downward.

502
00:47:32,500 --> 00:47:36,440
Because it's like pressure here pushing. We connect these two points.

503
00:47:37,120 --> 00:47:40,739
We connect the two points.

504
00:47:44,380 --> 00:47:45,059
Catch the back.

505
00:47:45,420 --> 00:47:47,659
Say this point touches with this point,

506
00:47:47,960 --> 00:47:50,320
this line would still come touch here, right?

507
00:47:50,720 --> 00:47:55,059
But when going up, it doesn't reach. It's like there's momentum from the other side

508
00:47:55,380 --> 00:48:01,019
pushing down, so there's a chance price will be pushed, pushed until it breaks through downward, penetrating the triangle downward.

509
00:48:01,579 --> 00:48:06,280
Method two for analyzing is what we've learned - the steepness.

510
00:48:07,660 --> 00:48:12,639
Look at its momentum. See it going up and down, up down up,

511
00:48:13,020 --> 00:48:16,380
but when going up, going up, this one's going up step one, going up step two,

512
00:48:16,860 --> 00:48:21,579
the steepness starts tilting out, see? Like this, opening.

513
00:48:22,820 --> 00:48:28,079
But when going up here, there's no momentum to rise. At the triangle tip.

514
00:48:28,079 --> 00:48:31,900
This is normal. This one, its rise, we can't really see

515
00:48:31,900 --> 00:48:35,460
what its momentum is like. But it's clear that the point where it reverses swing,

516
00:48:35,460 --> 00:48:44,099
the reversal, it doesn't reach here. This one reaches. But the momentum for it to reach,

517
00:48:45,019 --> 00:48:48,219
it tilts out, has low steepness, flattens out.

518
00:48:48,219 --> 00:48:51,380
So it shows there's downward pressure resisting here too.

519
00:48:51,680 --> 00:48:56,039
So there's a chance it'll break down like this. Meaning penetrating the triangle to the downside.

520
00:48:56,720 --> 00:48:58,559
Same thing. This is analyzing two methods.

521
00:49:00,200 --> 00:49:03,639
Separate from this one which is looking at analyzing more.

522
00:49:03,980 --> 00:49:16,199
Sort of like this. See? Here I drew it as a triangle. The steepness, see? Going up first attempt, going up second attempt, going up third attempt, see? Does it have momentum? Flattens out.

523
00:49:16,199 --> 00:49:24,400
In the end which side does it break? Breaks downward. Breaks, comes back up to pullback, see what I said about when trading, waiting to trade,

524
00:49:24,660 --> 00:49:30,139
sometimes some people trade the break at this candlestick, catch this candlestick then next candlestick continues down.

525
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:38,639
But if we want it safer, it'll come back up, pullback, then fall, then sell down.

526
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:44,579
There's a triangle here too. Here it's the same, the steepness, see?

527
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:48,539
Going up attempt 1, going up attempt 2, going up attempt 3, not much momentum.

528
00:49:49,220 --> 00:49:50,199
So it broke downward.

529
00:49:52,760 --> 00:49:55,880
As for this one, it went up. It's a triangle too, see?

530
00:49:55,880 --> 00:49:56,780
We connect lines connecting swings.

531
00:49:58,680 --> 00:50:01,420
Here it doesn't reach, see, it doesn't reach the trendline here.

532
00:50:01,420 --> 00:50:07,780
Like there's some momentum supporting it up. It won't come down, so it goes up.

533
00:50:09,080 --> 00:50:14,619
Two methods. See? Using both methods. It's up to whether you can analyze and see it.

534
00:50:15,980 --> 00:50:19,039
Something like that. This is an example from a real chart.

535
00:50:21,620 --> 00:50:27,500
Triangles. Rectangle will be a different pattern. Let's continue, should already understand.

536
00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:39,280
This one is engulfing. It's showing momentum. If you look, you'll already know it's a consolidation rise and curving, then it has a chance to go up like this.

537
00:50:40,060 --> 00:50:48,039
Next. This is called channel. A channel is like

538
00:50:48,039 --> 00:50:50,719
this, it's a channel.

539
00:51:11,579 --> 00:51:16,500
The chart runs like this. You ask why it's called a channel? Well when you draw

540
00:51:16,500 --> 00:51:19,079
trendlines framing it, it becomes a channel like this.

541
00:51:20,680 --> 00:51:24,880
And there's a chance it could form as, basically, price shoots up like this,

542
00:51:27,380 --> 00:51:32,539
where the name is. But when it actually happens, it can happen in two patterns.

543
00:51:32,539 --> 00:51:41,579
Channel first then spike, or spike first then channel.

544
00:51:43,380 --> 00:51:47,460
Now why is it important? We measure its height. The channel's height.

545
00:51:51,160 --> 00:52:01,199
The channel's height and when it spikes, it'll be about the same. About equal.

546
00:52:03,020 --> 00:52:10,920
Same thing. In this case it's the same. When it's a spike then channel, the height will be similar.

547
00:52:11,840 --> 00:52:14,019
And the channel, you ask why it's a channel?

548
00:52:14,019 --> 00:52:17,440
Because we can't draw lines, draw waves clearly.

549
00:52:17,460 --> 00:52:21,320
Inside the channel itself. It's quite confusing, quite messy.

550
00:52:21,320 --> 00:52:23,539
Normally if price runs well, it'll run

551
00:52:23,539 --> 00:52:31,539
gradually climbing up. But a channel will come out in the pattern of

552
00:52:32,880 --> 00:52:35,460
can't draw it. They overlap all over.

553
00:52:37,940 --> 00:52:41,239
Let's say that. This one really slid. Something like this.

554
00:52:42,060 --> 00:52:45,619
Then then suddenly, shoots up. That's it.

555
00:52:45,619 --> 00:52:51,659
Called channel spike. If we look at the chart, it'll be sort of like, where?

556
00:53:00,620 --> 00:53:08,280
Here. See? Shoots up, then becomes a channel, a box coming down, like this.

557
00:53:09,860 --> 00:53:11,960
So it's considered a channel spike.

558
00:53:14,120 --> 00:53:24,719
See? Here messy, messy in two waves, then drawing head to tail isn't possible, it goes through

559
00:53:26,120 --> 00:53:35,780
its own support and resistance. Perfectly can't do it. Not here. We'll draw here, it's all messed up around here.

560
00:53:39,580 --> 00:53:40,519
So it's a channel.

561
00:53:43,060 --> 00:53:43,579
Like this.

562
00:53:47,220 --> 00:53:47,739
Like this.

563
00:53:51,060 --> 00:53:54,440
Can draw it as a channel, see? Its head can be drawn together. It's a channel.

564
00:53:56,140 --> 00:54:01,139
Then it broke, and shot up as a spike, as a long candlestick breaking out of the channel box.

565
00:54:02,780 --> 00:54:03,960
See?

566
00:54:06,340 --> 00:54:10,900
Like this. It'll get roughly the distance that it penetrated the box.

567
00:54:11,960 --> 00:54:20,400
The reverse when it's spike first then channel, it gets about the same too.

568
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:21,639
See? Something like this.

569
00:54:24,700 --> 00:54:26,099
Get it? Something like this.

570
00:54:29,720 --> 00:54:34,300
Let's come back to detail again later. Let's go look at various patterns first.

571
00:54:35,980 --> 00:54:39,559
This one's called divergence, meaning price conflict.

572
00:54:40,100 --> 00:54:44,579
Conflict how? Normally if it's an uptrend, what has to happen is

573
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:47,159
highs have to keep getting higher, right?

574
00:54:47,600 --> 00:54:51,360
Lows have to keep lifting up. But when it reaches a certain peak,

575
00:54:52,460 --> 00:54:54,739
price is higher, that's true, these 2 peaks,

576
00:54:56,440 --> 00:55:01,460
but the low isn't lifted. The low stays similar or equal, or this low might even be lower.

577
00:55:09,559 --> 00:55:13,440
It's one warning sign that there might be a trend change from uptrend to downtrend.

578
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:16,659
When price loses balance it's messy. See?

579
00:55:17,019 --> 00:55:19,920
It swings around, opens wider.

580
00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:24,340
Meaning we don't know which side is dominant. Like it'll rise, it rises.

581
00:55:24,340 --> 00:55:25,960
Want to fall, it comes down.

582
00:55:26,820 --> 00:55:53,400
Then it plays back up. We'll try to catch the trade on the third attempt going up. If it's one, two, three, at this level, here, it might fall. Or it might fall here then continue up. Or it might fall here and penetrate long downward, changing trend entirely. To be sure, it already

583
00:55:53,400 --> 00:55:58,099
broke the original support here. Same for

584
00:56:02,980 --> 00:56:13,699
if it's downtrend. Round 3, one, two,

585
00:56:26,640 --> 00:56:29,519
3, here. The pattern will be

586
00:56:32,360 --> 00:56:35,880
let me look for it first.

587
00:56:37,320 --> 00:56:39,760
Just found one so I'll show you.

588
00:56:41,420 --> 00:56:45,800
This is a triangle. See, connect this point with this point.

589
00:56:46,660 --> 00:56:49,059
Then we analyze as we've analyzed. What happened?

590
00:56:50,380 --> 00:56:52,300
See that here there's 1, there's 2, there's 1, there's 2, it's a triangle.

591
00:56:52,660 --> 00:56:55,579
But when it goes up this round, it doesn't reach, see?

592
00:56:56,140 --> 00:56:58,860
Doesn't reach then it came down like this.

593
00:56:59,340 --> 00:57:03,320
Remember the rise pattern? Rises, topples down like this.

594
00:57:03,640 --> 00:57:07,219
Toppled down, so it has higher momentum going down than up.

595
00:57:07,219 --> 00:57:09,099
Now here it doesn't reach, so what happened? It broke down. Broke down, see?

596
00:57:10,800 --> 00:57:13,739
The candlestick broke down, came down, came back to test, retest.

597
00:57:13,739 --> 00:57:14,539
This one came back up to test.

598
00:57:16,120 --> 00:57:16,699
Changed from support to resistance, came up to test if it's really resistance.

599
00:57:18,080 --> 00:57:19,059
Then it falls.

600
00:57:19,900 --> 00:57:21,099
See?

601
00:57:21,099 --> 00:57:22,219
This is a triangle.

602
00:57:30,240 --> 00:57:31,139
Now let's look at divergence.

603
00:57:31,139 --> 00:57:34,860
Let me find it.

604
00:57:35,380 --> 00:57:39,800
Sort of like this.

605
00:57:40,480 --> 00:57:42,159
Sort of like this. This zone is sort of like it but might not be super clear.

606
00:57:45,160 --> 00:57:51,059
But it's still considered price losing balance. Losing balance how?

607
00:57:51,620 --> 00:57:59,679
It's an uptrend, see?

608
00:57:59,679 --> 00:58:03,880
Resistance. Here it made a higher high than before. But instead of lifting the low, it made a lower low than this one.

609
00:58:03,880 --> 00:58:10,219
And rounds back up. But this round it doesn't reach this part. Now it doesn't reach, so it shows

610
00:58:10,760 --> 00:58:11,760
if we're going to try to catch a sell trade, we might not catch it yet. But it's a point for us to be careful

611
00:58:25,500 --> 00:58:27,659
that it's about to change trend to downtrend. You ask why? Look at the waves.

612
00:58:29,720 --> 00:58:34,559
The steepness.

613
00:58:38,559 --> 00:58:41,400
What happened? Does it topple?

614
00:58:41,579 --> 00:58:44,559
Tilted this much, it topples. So it falls. That's it.

615
00:58:44,559 --> 00:58:48,480
If looking at uptrend, look at the steepness first.

616
00:58:48,480 --> 00:58:52,780
The steepness starts tilting more toward this side.

617
00:58:52,780 --> 00:58:55,519
Second, look at the wave shape.

618
00:58:55,519 --> 00:58:58,659
We saw the wave pattern already that the steepness, its angle is decreasing.

619
00:58:59,140 --> 00:59:05,860
Next look at the shape, it has three types.

620
00:59:09,180 --> 00:59:17,380
See? This pattern goes up as a wave, then it curves.

621
00:59:19,820 --> 00:59:25,280
It loses momentum, curves. This one goes up straight, goes up straight, goes up straight. But this one goes up and curves, see? It curves.

622
00:59:27,180 --> 00:59:29,179
Goes up straight, goes up straight, goes up straight, but this one goes up and curves. See, at resistance, lost energy. So it falls.

623
00:59:30,160 --> 00:59:32,780
Right? See, it curves. See? It curves then falls, this one, see? Long too.

624
00:59:33,180 --> 00:59:35,860
First it'll warn us already when divergence happens.

625
00:59:35,860 --> 00:59:37,219
High rises, high rises, rises, rises,

626
00:59:38,740 --> 00:59:39,719
low lifts, lifts, lifts, but the low drops down.

627
00:59:40,140 --> 00:59:42,699
Then the high starts dropping down too.

628
00:59:43,460 --> 00:59:45,280
Then it goes up again.

629
00:59:45,280 --> 00:59:48,960
This one's higher than this one. But this one is lower than this one again.

630
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:52,980
This could be called divergence.

631
00:59:52,980 --> 01:00:00,480
It might not be as clear as the theoretical drawing.

632
01:00:01,560 --> 01:00:05,440
But we analyze with other things together, analyze the wave.

633
01:00:06,440 --> 01:00:10,000
Sometimes if looking at candlesticks, sometimes if you're not good at seeing its momentum, seeing where it's losing momentum, which is more,

634
01:00:10,280 --> 01:00:14,219
you might wonder if it'll go up or go down. Look at the wave together.

635
01:00:15,880 --> 01:00:20,559
We'll see the wave, it'll be clearer. The wave when it goes up has this much steepness.

636
01:00:21,540 --> 01:00:24,760
Then it gradually tilts out. Here looking at steepness. Looking at second thing,

637
01:00:26,760 --> 01:00:32,179
when it goes up, it goes up as a straight line like this, goes up like this, goes up like this,

638
01:00:32,179 --> 01:00:36,199
but here it's not straight. See it curves outward.

639
01:00:37,840 --> 01:00:39,659
Shows that the force or momentum is losing energy here.

640
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:59,980
So it falls. There's a higher chance of falling than rising. I use this term better.

641
01:00:59,980 --> 01:01:04,519
So it falls. Latest is roughly this.
