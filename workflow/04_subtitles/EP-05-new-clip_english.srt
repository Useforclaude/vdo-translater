00:00:01,060 --> 00:00:07,599
Hello everyone, and welcome back to the final part of Reading Charts Like Watching a Movie.

2
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:17,039
We read charts, we view charts like we're reading a book, reading a novel, watching a movie, watching a series, watching any show we enjoy.

3
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:25,519
If we keep following it and analyzing the plot as we go, it'll make our chart analysis more accurate and help us see another dimension.

4
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:30,600
Beyond just drawing lines all over the place and analyzing using the common techniques that are already being taught out there.

5
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:34,240
Like support and resistance, candlestick patterns and all that.

6
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:36,200
How many patterns to memorize, how many pattern types there are.

7
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:37,240
Triangle patterns.

8
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:42,340
Different triangle types, there are so many types of triangles.

9
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:45,399
Flags, pennants, all kinds of stuff like that.

10
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:49,719
Instead of just memorizing all that, we'll go deeper - to the point where we don't even need to memorize.

11
00:00:49,719 --> 00:00:54,079
We understand the flow, we understand the story.

12
00:00:54,780 --> 00:01:01,020
We understand what the price wants to do, what direction it wants to go.

13
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:07,319
Once we understand this, we'll know which way to trade.

14
00:01:07,319 --> 00:01:10,400
So today we're continuing from where we left off.

15
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:13,900
We've covered how to read charts like reading a story.

16
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:16,859
How each candlestick is like a character in a movie.

17
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:20,099
Some candles are protagonists, some are villains.

18
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:23,819
Some are supporting characters, some are extras.

19
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:27,500
Today we're going deeper into understanding the characters.

20
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:30,500
We need to know their personalities, their roles.

21
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:40,379
Just like when we watch a series and we get to know each character.

22
00:01:40,579 --> 00:01:45,739
We know who's the main character, who's the villain.

23
00:01:45,739 --> 00:01:48,819
We know what each one is trying to do.

24
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:54,000
In charts, it's the same thing.

25
00:01:56,860 --> 00:01:59,599
Each candle has its own role.

26
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:03,500
Large candles are like main characters.

27
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:08,780
Small candles are like extras, background characters.

28
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:17,979
The really big, powerful candles - those are the bosses.

29
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:24,259
Those are what we call the commanders.

30
00:02:24,259 --> 00:02:30,139
In Thai we call them "แม่ทัพ" - the major candles that lead the action.

31
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:36,840
From Dow Theory, from the Dow theory, the story or plot direction

32
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:41,719
Which side is the story supporting - the hero side or the villain side?

33
00:02:41,719 --> 00:02:47,039
We need to stick with them, follow along. Whichever way they're paving the road, we follow that flow.

34
00:02:47,039 --> 00:02:51,020
Be a friend of the hero or be a friend of the villain, be a follower going along with them.

35
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:56,199
Don't go against it or the fans won't like it. If during this part of the story

36
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:01,819
They're building up the hero to look good, the hero keeps winning

37
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:05,039
And we go with the villain side? We'll lose. You know what I mean?

38
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:10,379
On the flip side, if they're building up the villain to look amazing, look superior

39
00:03:10,379 --> 00:03:16,079
And we go with the hero side at that point, it might look bad - we might get beaten by the villain side

40
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:22,360
They have the upper hand. The hero still can't turn

41
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:28,199
The plot around, can't reverse their role to overcome the villain.

42
00:03:28,199 --> 00:03:30,080
The villain side is still dominating.

43
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:34,979
So our job as viewers, when we practice reading charts like watching a movie

44
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:41,039
Something we enjoy, we just watch. We look at the big picture

45
00:03:41,039 --> 00:03:46,500
Which way is it going? We follow that direction. We ride the momentum

46
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:51,919
If the plot is favoring the hero, we follow the hero. If it favors the villain

47
00:03:51,919 --> 00:03:56,460
We follow the villain. Following the hero or villain means - if the trend is up

48
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:58,080
We follow the uptrend

49
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:01,680
If it's a downtrend, we trade with the downtrend, going down

50
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:04,960
Don't fight it. Either way, we'll survive.

51
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:08,699
But if we fight against it

52
00:04:08,699 --> 00:04:10,960
Go against the trend, we'll definitely lose

53
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,300
100% we'll lose

54
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:16,439
So that's why we need to understand which way the story is going

55
00:04:16,439 --> 00:04:19,459
Which side is dominating right now

56
00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:23,060
Once we know that, now we look at the characters

57
00:04:23,299 --> 00:04:27,680
We look at each candlestick

58
00:04:28,219 --> 00:04:32,439
Which candles are the main characters? Which are supporting characters?

59
00:04:32,439 --> 00:04:36,620
The large candles are the main characters

60
00:04:37,159 --> 00:04:40,480
The small ones are just extras

61
00:04:40,759 --> 00:04:45,160
Now when we look at the chart, when we look at the characters

62
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:49,000
We see large candles, small candles mixed together

63
00:04:49,319 --> 00:04:55,699
Some go up, some go down, all kinds of them

64
00:04:55,699 --> 00:04:58,839
We need to identify which ones are the key characters

65
00:04:59,479 --> 00:05:05,300
If you see a really big candle

66
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:10,319
Way bigger than the others around it

67
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:16,559
That's a main character, that's a boss

68
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:19,100
That's what we call a major candle

69
00:05:19,379 --> 00:05:23,480
These major candles have power

70
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:28,240
They can change the direction of price

71
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:33,959
If price breaks through that major candle

72
00:05:33,959 --> 00:05:40,000
It means that side has overcome the boss

73
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:45,399
And price can continue in that direction

74
00:05:45,659 --> 00:05:49,379
But if it can't break through

75
00:05:49,379 --> 00:05:52,040
It means the boss is still holding strong

76
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:54,339
Price will bounce back

77
00:05:54,339 --> 00:05:55,500
This is why we need to watch for these major candles

78
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:57,079
They're like commanders in a battle

79
00:05:57,259 --> 00:05:58,160
If the commander falls, the whole army falls

80
00:05:58,719 --> 00:06:01,639
If the commander holds, the army holds

81
00:06:01,639 --> 00:06:04,279
Same thing with price action

82
00:06:04,279 --> 00:06:06,360
When you see these major candles at key levels

83
00:06:07,579 --> 00:06:08,620
At resistance or support

84
00:06:08,919 --> 00:06:10,139
Those are critical scenes in the story

85
00:06:10,139 --> 00:06:11,579
That's where the battle happens

86
00:06:11,859 --> 00:06:13,439
That's where we see if the bulls or bears will win

87
00:06:14,159 --> 00:06:15,500
Now let's look at an example

88
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,120
Look at this chart here

89
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,860
See this large candle? This is a major candle

90
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:20,420
It's much bigger than the ones around it

91
00:06:20,719 --> 00:06:23,400
And it's at a resistance level

92
00:06:23,399 --> 00:06:26,500
This is a key scene

93
00:06:27,559 --> 00:06:29,879
The bulls are trying to push through

94
00:06:29,879 --> 00:06:32,019
But the bears are defending with this major candle

95
00:06:32,019 --> 00:06:35,800
See what happens next?

96
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,779
Price tries to go up but keeps getting rejected

97
00:06:37,779 --> 00:06:39,420
Because this major candle is holding

98
00:06:39,819 --> 00:06:43,079
The bears are in control here

99
00:06:43,079 --> 00:06:48,079
This is their territory

100
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:50,399
Until something changes, we trade with the bears

101
00:06:50,599 --> 00:06:57,899
Then we can decide what happens next, which way will the plot turn?

102
00:06:58,599 --> 00:07:00,740
Will it favor the hero side or will the villain side take over?

103
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:06,779
Then we play along with that.

104
00:07:06,779 --> 00:07:10,839
Now, to know which side has the role

105
00:07:10,839 --> 00:07:15,439
We need to get to know the characters, the personality of each character.

106
00:07:15,439 --> 00:07:21,480
What's their mood like? You know?

107
00:07:21,659 --> 00:07:25,360
Like candlesticks - if a candle is this size

108
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:29,199
A really big candle like this is considered the main character, the lead.

109
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:34,660
The boss of the story. Whether it's the boss on the hero side or the villain side.

110
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:37,879
Like in Game of Thrones, it'd be these two as the standouts.

111
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:41,639
I'll use green for the hero side and red for this one.

112
00:07:41,939 --> 00:07:44,579
This green one, when I say big candle

113
00:07:44,579 --> 00:07:47,339
It's a really large candle, way bigger than the others around it.

114
00:07:48,240 --> 00:08:04,899
This is a main character.

115
00:08:04,899 --> 00:08:11,560
The small ones are just extras, background characters.

116
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:16,819
They don't have much power or role.

117
00:08:17,619 --> 00:08:24,019
But the big ones, those are the key players.

118
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:29,699
When you see a candle like this at a key level

119
00:08:29,699 --> 00:08:35,039
That's a major scene, an important scene.

120
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:40,299
That's where the action happens.

121
00:08:40,639 --> 00:08:44,460
Like in a movie, there are scenes that aren't important

122
00:08:46,419 --> 00:08:50,039
Just filler, just showing daily life.

123
00:08:50,039 --> 00:08:53,159
But then there are key scenes, critical scenes.

124
00:08:53,159 --> 00:08:56,059
Where the main characters face off.

125
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:02,740
Those are the scenes we need to pay attention to.

126
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:07,000
Same with charts.

127
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,199
There are areas where not much happens.

128
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:12,159
Just small candles, price going sideways.

129
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:13,919
But then there are key levels - resistance, support.

130
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:18,279
That's where the major candles show up.

131
00:09:18,279 --> 00:09:20,019
That's where we see the battle.

132
00:09:20,019 --> 00:09:22,139
Will the bulls break through or will the bears hold?

133
00:09:22,139 --> 00:09:25,379
These major candles tell us the answer.

134
00:09:25,379 --> 00:09:26,100
If a big green candle breaks through resistance

135
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:27,759
The bulls have won that battle.

136
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,500
Price will continue up.

137
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:32,680
But if the bears defend with a big red candle

138
00:09:32,679 --> 00:09:39,519
That tells us the bears are still in control.

139
00:09:40,639 --> 00:10:02,519
Price will go back down.

140
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:07,919
So we need to watch for these major candles at key levels.

141
00:10:07,919 --> 00:10:15,500
They're like commanders leading their armies.

142
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:18,519
If you see a large army, lots of volume, big candle

143
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,940
That side has strength, has power.

144
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:23,899
But if you see just a small force, small candle

145
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:25,860
That side doesn't have much power.

146
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:28,039
They probably can't win that battle.

147
00:10:30,140 --> 00:10:31,960
So when we analyze the chart

148
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:34,980
We look at the big picture first - which way is the trend?

149
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:36,879
Then we look closer at each scene.

150
00:10:36,879 --> 00:10:38,639
We look at the characters in that scene.

151
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:41,679
That's happening around the world.

152
00:10:41,679 --> 00:10:43,200
We look at who are the main characters, who are the supporting characters.

153
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,460
Who's leading the action.

154
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:48,679
Once we see that, we know which way to trade.

155
00:10:48,679 --> 00:10:50,500
If the bulls have the big candles, the major candles

156
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:52,139
The bulls are in control.

157
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:53,919
We trade with the bulls.

158
00:10:53,919 --> 00:10:56,720
If the bears have the major candles

159
00:10:56,980 --> 00:10:58,600
The bears are dominating.

160
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,340
We trade with the bears.

161
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:02,320
It's that simple.

162
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:05,320
We don't fight the main characters.

163
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:13,980
We go with them.

164
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:18,519
Now let's look at this in more detail.

165
00:11:18,759 --> 00:11:24,299
When we see candles at key levels

166
00:11:24,299 --> 00:11:29,200
Like here at this resistance

167
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:32,000
Look at this candle.

168
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,240
This is a major candle.

169
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:39,340
It's way bigger than the others.

170
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:45,940
And it formed right at resistance.

171
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:51,100
This tells us the bears are defending strongly.

172
00:11:51,439 --> 00:11:55,740
They don't want price to break through.

173
00:11:55,740 --> 00:12:09,100
So what do we do?

174
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:17,820
We wait and watch.

175
00:12:19,020 --> 00:12:28,159
Can the bulls overcome this major candle?

176
00:12:29,019 --> 00:12:33,399
Can they break through?

177
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:36,740
If they can, the bulls win.

178
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:43,740
Price goes higher.

179
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:51,019
But if they can't

180
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:56,940
The bears hold.

181
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:59,960
Price bounces back down.

182
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:05,379
This is how we read the story.

183
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:13,840
Each candle tells us something.

184
00:13:15,919 --> 00:13:19,559
But the big ones, the major candles

185
00:13:20,199 --> 00:13:24,740
Those tell us the most important parts.

186
00:13:27,379 --> 00:13:29,480
Those are the key moments in the story.

187
00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:33,460
Now, sometimes you'll see

188
00:13:37,059 --> 00:13:38,659
Two sides that are evenly matched.

189
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:45,440
Bulls and bears both have strength.

190
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:47,919
In Thai we call this 'สูสี' - neck and neck.

191
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:55,679
When you see this, be careful.

192
00:13:55,679 --> 00:13:58,299
The battle isn't decided yet.

193
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:05,539
Wait to see who wins.

194
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:13,679
Don't jump in too early.

195
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Wait for a clear winner.

196
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:30,940
Then trade with the winner.

197
00:14:31,339 --> 00:14:34,980
This is the smart way to trade.

198
00:14:36,279 --> 00:14:38,799
Follow the story.

199
00:14:45,299 --> 00:14:53,059
Go with the main characters.

200
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:05,019
Don't try to predict what'll happen.

201
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:09,600
Right here. See? This big spike here.

202
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:17,480
Just watch what happens.

203
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:24,320
See how the story unfolds.

204
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:36,019
Then trade accordingly.

205
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:44,620
This is much easier

206
00:15:45,119 --> 00:15:50,539
Than trying to memorize hundreds of patterns.

207
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:55,639
We just read the story.

208
00:15:57,500 --> 00:16:01,940
We understand the flow.

209
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:05,519
We know who's winning.

210
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:12,360
And we go with the winner.

211
00:16:12,879 --> 00:16:20,259
Simple as that.

212
00:16:20,259 --> 00:16:23,940
Now let's look at some real examples.

213
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:27,240
I'll show you how to apply this.

214
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:31,120
Look at this chart.

215
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:37,899
What do you see?

216
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:41,059
First, what's the big picture?

217
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:50,659
What's the trend?

218
00:16:52,520 --> 00:17:00,200
Is it going up?

219
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:09,720
Going down?

220
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:15,039
Or sideways?

221
00:17:15,419 --> 00:17:19,200
Once we know that

222
00:17:20,419 --> 00:17:24,960
Then we look at the candles.

223
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:30,559
Which ones are the major candles?

224
00:17:32,659 --> 00:17:35,559
Where are they located?

225
00:17:36,779 --> 00:17:39,680
Are they at key levels?

226
00:17:40,439 --> 00:17:56,660
If yes, those are important scenes.

227
00:17:56,660 --> 00:18:09,539
Pay attention to those.

228
00:18:11,479 --> 00:18:19,799
See what happens there.

229
00:18:20,299 --> 00:18:25,880
Do the bulls break through?

230
00:18:26,899 --> 00:18:32,799
Or do the bears hold?

231
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:38,079
Whatever happens

232
00:18:38,719 --> 00:18:44,839
We trade with the winner.

233
00:18:49,799 --> 00:18:55,079
Don't fight it.

234
00:18:55,399 --> 00:18:58,880
Don't try to be a hero.

235
00:18:59,399 --> 00:19:02,720
Just follow the story.

236
00:19:03,719 --> 00:19:13,139
Now here's an interesting part.

237
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:24,460
Sometimes the story changes.

238
00:19:25,879 --> 00:19:29,599
The plot twists.

239
00:19:31,859 --> 00:19:35,700
The hero becomes the villain.

240
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:46,960
Or the villain becomes the hero.

241
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,180
How do we know when this happens?

242
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:02,319
We watch for key changes.

243
00:20:06,759 --> 00:20:15,000
Major candles appearing at key levels.

244
00:20:16,359 --> 00:20:21,500
Trend reversals.

245
00:20:22,599 --> 00:20:27,839
When an uptrend can't make new highs anymore.

246
00:20:28,459 --> 00:20:32,019
Or a downtrend can't make new lows.

247
00:20:32,319 --> 00:20:36,619
That's when the plot might be changing.

248
00:20:38,619 --> 00:20:40,599
The story might be turning.

249
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:44,640
We need to be ready.

250
00:20:45,939 --> 00:20:50,259
Maybe the other side is taking over.

251
00:20:50,779 --> 00:20:53,019
Now we know the plot, right?

252
00:20:57,019 --> 00:20:59,339
We understand the story structure.

253
00:21:00,139 --> 00:21:04,599
So we can anticipate what might happen next.

254
00:21:04,599 --> 00:21:09,079
But we don't guess.

255
00:21:09,079 --> 00:21:14,819
We wait for confirmation.

256
00:21:15,259 --> 00:21:19,559
We wait for the chart to show us.

257
00:21:21,379 --> 00:21:27,740
Then we act.

258
00:21:28,079 --> 00:21:31,720
This is the safe way to trade.

259
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:36,500
Follow the evidence.

260
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:42,039
Not our emotions.

261
00:21:42,419 --> 00:21:53,059
Not our predictions.

262
00:21:54,939 --> 00:22:06,740
Just what the chart is telling us.

263
00:22:07,299 --> 00:22:13,960
What the story is showing us.

264
00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:17,400
Now let's talk about momentum.

265
00:22:17,699 --> 00:22:20,640
Momentum is like the energy of the story.

266
00:22:21,699 --> 00:22:25,539
When a scene has lots of action

267
00:22:26,299 --> 00:22:28,579
Lots of drama

268
00:22:29,759 --> 00:22:30,559
That's high momentum.

269
00:22:33,319 --> 00:22:35,799
Big candles, strong moves.

270
00:22:37,899 --> 00:22:41,619
Price moving fast in one direction.

271
00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:44,380
When you see this

272
00:22:44,380 --> 00:22:46,920
That side has the power.

273
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:50,299
They're dominating.

274
00:22:51,799 --> 00:22:54,440
But when the action slows down

275
00:22:56,459 --> 00:22:57,059
Small candles, sideways movement

276
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:01,940
That's low momentum.

277
00:23:04,039 --> 00:23:06,339
Neither side has clear control.

278
00:23:15,459 --> 00:23:24,500
This is when we need to be careful.

279
00:23:28,959 --> 00:23:33,140
Don't force a trade.

280
00:23:36,719 --> 00:23:44,180
Wait for the story to pick up again.

281
00:23:50,919 --> 00:24:02,539
Wait for one side to take control.

282
00:24:02,959 --> 00:24:03,119
Then we trade with them.

283
00:24:03,419 --> 00:24:05,619
This is how professionals trade.

284
00:24:06,279 --> 00:24:15,920
They don't trade all the time.

285
00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:19,799
They wait for the right moments.

286
00:24:20,919 --> 00:24:23,859
The right scenes.

287
00:24:27,139 --> 00:24:30,099
When the story is clear.

288
00:24:33,339 --> 00:24:48,240
When one side is dominating.

289
00:24:48,679 --> 00:25:01,039
That's when they enter.

290
00:25:01,299 --> 00:25:10,559
And they go with the dominant side.

291
00:25:11,619 --> 00:25:16,720
Never against it.

292
00:25:17,019 --> 00:25:23,799
This is the key principle.

293
00:25:24,459 --> 00:25:32,599
Follow the strength.

294
00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:42,740
Trade with the flow.

295
00:25:43,319 --> 00:25:47,299
Don't fight the market.

296
00:25:47,299 --> 00:25:51,579
The market is always right.

297
00:25:51,579 --> 00:25:55,940
Our job is to adapt.

298
00:25:55,940 --> 00:25:58,620
To go with what's happening.

299
00:25:58,619 --> 00:26:04,700
Not to predict what will happen.

300
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,960
But to react to what is happening.

301
00:26:17,539 --> 00:26:19,039
Now let's look at a real chart example.

302
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:27,619
This is a live chart.

303
00:26:29,399 --> 00:26:36,119
Look at the overall trend first.

304
00:26:36,119 --> 00:26:40,940
What do you see?

305
00:26:40,940 --> 00:26:45,319
Price is making higher highs and higher lows.

306
00:26:45,319 --> 00:26:48,619
This is an uptrend.

307
00:26:49,079 --> 00:26:53,839
The bulls are in control.

308
00:26:54,279 --> 00:26:59,019
This is the big picture.

309
00:26:59,379 --> 00:27:03,819
Now let's zoom in.

310
00:27:04,319 --> 00:27:08,719
Look at this level here.

311
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:12,400
This is a key resistance level.

312
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:17,099
Price tested it multiple times.

313
00:27:17,099 --> 00:27:25,039
See these candles?

314
00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:27,619
These are major candles.

315
00:27:27,619 --> 00:27:32,240
Big red candles defending this level.

316
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:36,799
The bears are putting up a fight.

317
00:27:37,419 --> 00:27:39,700
They don't want price to break through.

318
00:27:40,519 --> 00:27:43,160
But look what happens.

319
00:27:45,559 --> 00:27:48,319
Price keeps coming back.

320
00:27:50,099 --> 00:27:51,339
The bulls keep trying.

321
00:27:53,019 --> 00:27:56,079
Each time they try

322
00:27:56,259 --> 00:28:18,099
They get rejected.

323
00:28:18,099 --> 00:28:23,400
But each rejection is weaker.

324
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:30,140
The bears are losing strength.

325
00:28:30,140 --> 00:28:35,140
See how the red candles are getting smaller?

326
00:28:35,639 --> 00:28:41,299
This tells us something.

327
00:28:44,239 --> 00:28:49,039
The bears can't defend forever.

328
00:28:49,039 --> 00:28:54,180
They're running out of steam.

329
00:28:58,359 --> 00:29:08,619
And then look.

330
00:29:11,899 --> 00:29:18,940
Here comes a big green candle.

331
00:29:21,259 --> 00:29:25,220
This is a major candle on the bull side.

332
00:29:25,519 --> 00:29:29,220
It breaks through the resistance.

333
00:29:30,779 --> 00:29:35,259
The bulls have won this battle.

334
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:43,579
The plot has shifted.

335
00:29:43,579 --> 00:29:45,859
Now the bulls are dominating even more.

336
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:52,240
What do we do?

337
00:29:52,240 --> 00:30:01,920
We go with the bulls.

338
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:14,640
We don't fight them.

339
00:30:17,799 --> 00:30:26,359
We trade in their direction.

340
00:30:27,979 --> 00:30:32,359
This is how you read the story.

341
00:30:33,199 --> 00:30:44,980
You see the battle.

342
00:30:47,799 --> 00:30:48,420
You see who's winning.

343
00:30:55,239 --> 00:30:57,500
You see when the plot shifts.

344
00:30:58,399 --> 00:31:01,220
Then you trade accordingly.

345
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:04,059
Now let's look at another example.

346
00:31:04,319 --> 00:31:06,039
This time a downtrend.

347
00:31:06,220 --> 00:31:08,079
Price making lower lows and lower highs.

348
00:31:08,079 --> 00:31:09,740
The bears are in control.

349
00:31:09,740 --> 00:31:10,819
Look at this support level.

350
00:31:12,259 --> 00:31:16,859
Price keeps testing it.

351
00:31:17,859 --> 00:31:22,319
The bulls try to defend.

352
00:31:23,299 --> 00:31:28,039
But the bears keep pushing down.

353
00:31:29,980 --> 00:31:34,819
Look at these big red candles.

354
00:31:40,819 --> 00:31:43,099
Major candles on the bear side.

355
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:46,960
They're dominating.

356
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:50,200
Each time price tries to bounce

357
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:54,740
The bears push it back down.

358
00:31:54,740 --> 00:32:10,799
This tells us the bears are strong.

359
00:32:10,799 --> 00:32:14,599
They're in control.

360
00:32:15,180 --> 00:32:16,420
So what do we do?

361
00:32:16,919 --> 00:32:20,200
We trade with the bears.

362
00:32:20,619 --> 00:32:22,779
We go short.

363
00:32:23,439 --> 00:32:26,519
We don't try to pick a bottom.

364
00:32:26,519 --> 00:32:27,960
We don't try to be heroes.

365
00:32:29,159 --> 00:32:31,700
We just follow the story.

366
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:32,660
The bears are dominating, we go with them.

367
00:32:34,159 --> 00:32:39,059
Until the story changes.

368
00:32:39,919 --> 00:32:45,619
Until we see signs of reversal.

369
00:32:47,359 --> 00:32:53,220
Then we'll adjust.

370
00:32:54,559 --> 00:32:59,220
But for now, we follow the bears.

371
00:32:59,220 --> 00:33:06,779
This is the key to successful trading.

372
00:33:07,859 --> 00:33:15,440
Reading the story.

373
00:33:17,879 --> 00:33:20,680
Understanding who's in control.

374
00:33:23,319 --> 00:33:27,559
Then trading with them.

375
00:33:28,299 --> 00:33:31,099
Not against them.

376
00:33:31,419 --> 00:33:36,380
Now let's talk about key scenes.

377
00:33:37,219 --> 00:33:40,680
Important levels in the chart.

378
00:33:41,039 --> 00:33:50,660
These are like critical scenes in a movie.

379
00:33:51,099 --> 00:33:57,319
Where the main action happens.

380
00:33:57,319 --> 00:34:00,160
Where the battle takes place.

381
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:05,440
How do we identify these key scenes?

382
00:34:06,399 --> 00:34:09,280
Look for previous highs and lows.

383
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:12,059
Look for levels where price reacted strongly before.

384
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:15,119
These become support and resistance.

385
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:16,639
When price comes back to these levels

386
00:34:16,980 --> 00:34:19,019
That's a key scene.

387
00:34:19,019 --> 00:34:22,320
That's where we pay attention.

388
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:25,300
Watch what the major candles do there.

389
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:27,480
Do they break through?

390
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:32,699
Or do they bounce back?

391
00:34:32,699 --> 00:34:38,980
This tells us what happens next.

392
00:34:38,980 --> 00:34:42,980
If they break through, the trend continues.

393
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:47,679
If they bounce back, we might see a reversal.

394
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:50,599
These key scenes are where the story turns.

395
00:34:50,860 --> 00:34:53,000
Where the plot shifts.

396
00:34:54,340 --> 00:34:56,780
So we need to watch them carefully.

397
00:34:57,800 --> 00:35:01,639
Don't just trade randomly.

398
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:05,619
Wait for these key scenes.

399
00:35:05,619 --> 00:35:07,300
Wait for the important moments.

400
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:09,099
Then make your move.

401
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:15,480
Now let's talk about patterns.

402
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:19,039
You might know some common patterns.

403
00:35:19,039 --> 00:35:22,019
Head and shoulders, triangles, flags.

404
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:26,739
These are all good.

405
00:35:26,980 --> 00:35:39,079
But when you understand the story

406
00:35:39,780 --> 00:35:44,920
You don't need to memorize them.

407
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:50,639
Because you understand why they work.

408
00:35:50,639 --> 00:35:53,000
A head and shoulders pattern - what is it really?

409
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:57,420
It's showing us a shift in the story.

410
00:35:57,940 --> 00:36:01,119
The bulls were in control.

411
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:05,000
They made a high - the left shoulder.

412
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:09,639
Then an even higher high - the head.

413
00:36:09,639 --> 00:36:13,119
But then they can't go higher.

414
00:36:13,119 --> 00:36:16,820
They only make it to the same level as before - right shoulder.

415
00:36:16,820 --> 00:36:23,199
This tells us the bulls are losing strength.

416
00:36:24,620 --> 00:36:30,840
The story might be changing.

417
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:46,800
When the neckline breaks

418
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:50,940
That confirms it - the bears have taken over.

419
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:55,059
See? We don't need to memorize.

420
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:58,760
We just understand the story.

421
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:16,780
Same with triangles.

422
00:37:16,780 --> 00:37:19,900
What's really happening?

423
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:23,699
Bulls and bears are evenly matched.

424
00:37:23,699 --> 00:37:26,800
Price is consolidating.

425
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:31,340
Getting tighter and tighter.

426
00:37:31,340 --> 00:37:35,340
Building energy.

427
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:39,519
Then eventually one side wins.

428
00:37:39,519 --> 00:37:44,599
Price breaks out.

429
00:37:44,599 --> 00:37:49,699
That's just the story playing out.

430
00:37:49,699 --> 00:37:53,659
Once you see it this way

431
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:59,699
Charts become so much easier.

432
00:37:59,699 --> 00:38:05,099
You're not memorizing patterns.

433
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:08,099
You're reading a story.

434
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:13,780
You're watching a movie.

435
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:20,679
Much more interesting, right?

436
00:38:21,100 --> 00:38:24,219
And more effective too.

437
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:30,019
Because you understand the why.

438
00:38:30,260 --> 00:38:33,619
Not just the what.

439
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:41,159
Now let's look at timeframes.

440
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:46,420
Different timeframes tell different parts of the story.

441
00:38:47,340 --> 00:38:52,480
The higher timeframe is the main plot.

442
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:57,980
The bigger picture.

443
00:38:57,980 --> 00:39:03,440
The lower timeframes are the details.

444
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:11,940
The scene-by-scene action.

445
00:39:11,940 --> 00:39:16,320
You need to understand both.

446
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:21,280
Always check the higher timeframe first.

447
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:33,420
What's the main story?

448
00:39:33,740 --> 00:39:34,579
Which way is it going?

449
00:39:34,579 --> 00:39:37,400
Then zoom into lower timeframes.

450
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:39,739
To find your entry and exit.

451
00:39:39,739 --> 00:39:40,340
But don't trade against the main story.

452
00:39:42,579 --> 00:39:43,059
If the daily chart shows uptrend

453
00:39:44,780 --> 00:39:45,400
Don't go short on the 5-minute chart.

454
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:46,780
You're fighting the main plot.

455
00:39:49,140 --> 00:39:50,000
Trade with the main story.

456
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,300
Use lower timeframes to fine-tune your entries.

457
00:39:52,020 --> 00:39:53,320
Not to trade against the trend.

458
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:55,559
This is a common mistake.

459
00:39:55,559 --> 00:39:57,320
People see a setup on lower timeframe

460
00:39:57,660 --> 00:40:00,019
But it's against the higher timeframe trend.

461
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:01,500
They take the trade and lose.

462
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:04,599
Because they're fighting the main story.

463
00:40:04,940 --> 00:40:07,219
Always align with the bigger picture.

464
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:09,940
Now let's talk about momentum again.

465
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:13,860
Momentum is important.

466
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:19,219
It tells us how strong the move is.

467
00:40:19,219 --> 00:40:20,940
High momentum - big candles, fast moves.

468
00:40:20,940 --> 00:40:26,000
This means that side is dominating.

469
00:40:29,180 --> 00:40:32,639
Low momentum - small candles, slow moves.

470
00:40:32,639 --> 00:40:35,099
Neither side is in control.

471
00:40:35,099 --> 00:40:39,480
When momentum is high

472
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:44,960
That's when we want to trade.

473
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:49,059
Because the story is clear.

474
00:40:49,059 --> 00:40:52,699
One side is winning.

475
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:59,900
When momentum is low

476
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:05,079
Be careful.

477
00:41:06,180 --> 00:41:09,659
The story isn't clear yet.

478
00:41:10,260 --> 00:41:13,679
Wait for it to pick up.

479
00:41:14,860 --> 00:41:16,340
Wait for one side to take control.

480
00:41:20,420 --> 00:41:25,719
Then trade with them.

481
00:41:25,719 --> 00:41:32,679
This is how you avoid getting chopped.

482
00:41:32,679 --> 00:41:37,519
Don't trade in low momentum periods.

483
00:41:37,519 --> 00:41:42,199
Wait for the story to develop.

484
00:41:42,740 --> 00:41:45,659
Wait for clear direction.

485
00:41:46,340 --> 00:41:49,019
Then make your move.

486
00:41:49,519 --> 00:41:53,179
This will save you so much money.

487
00:41:53,179 --> 00:41:55,639
And make you so much more.

488
00:41:55,639 --> 00:41:58,099
Because you're trading with clarity.

489
00:41:58,539 --> 00:41:59,780
With understanding.

490
00:42:00,580 --> 00:42:02,519
Not just guessing.

491
00:42:02,519 --> 00:42:03,639
Now let's look at this chart here.

492
00:42:03,639 --> 00:42:04,159
See this consolidation?

493
00:42:04,159 --> 00:42:05,559
Small candles, low momentum.

494
00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:08,579
Bulls and bears are evenly matched.

495
00:42:09,660 --> 00:42:10,860
The story is paused.

496
00:42:10,860 --> 00:42:12,900
We don't know who will win yet.

497
00:42:12,900 --> 00:42:14,559
So what do we do?

498
00:42:14,559 --> 00:42:16,139
We wait.

499
00:42:17,260 --> 00:42:18,059
We don't force it.

500
00:42:19,380 --> 00:42:23,760
We let the story develop.

501
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:36,820
And then see which side wins.

502
00:42:37,660 --> 00:42:46,679
See, like this - it's a pin bar right here.

503
00:42:46,679 --> 00:42:53,800
If we combine these two candles together

504
00:42:54,820 --> 00:42:59,039
It becomes a candle like this. This candle formed at resistance.

505
00:42:59,039 --> 00:43:03,000
At resistance, it has more significance than forming elsewhere. If it appeared in the middle somewhere, it wouldn't mean much.

506
00:43:04,220 --> 00:43:11,460
But it's at resistance - meaning it's at their fortress, at their stronghold.

507
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:16,619
They're counterattacking. They have the strength to fight back. So that's why it continues down like this.

508
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:23,539
See? And then momentum comes back and it goes down. It couldn't go deeper than before, couldn't make a lower low yet.

509
00:43:23,539 --> 00:43:28,340
When it came down, it's stuck right at support, at support.

510
00:43:28,340 --> 00:43:31,099
It's stuck right at the support level. The battle continues like this, see?

511
00:43:31,099 --> 00:43:34,619
Then when it goes up, and when it drops

512
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:53,519
When it drops, it bounces back up. See? Drops then bounces up.

513
00:43:53,519 --> 00:43:55,039
Then it goes up. See? The plot, see?

514
00:43:55,519 --> 00:43:56,840
Who's in control here?

515
00:44:01,080 --> 00:44:03,480
The buy side is in control, the bulls.

516
00:44:03,480 --> 00:44:06,679
So we trade with the bulls.

517
00:44:07,060 --> 00:44:07,960
We go long.

518
00:44:08,420 --> 00:44:11,800
Until something changes.

519
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:16,199
Until we see the bears taking over.

520
00:44:16,199 --> 00:44:23,539
But for now, bulls are dominating.

521
00:44:23,700 --> 00:44:29,380
So we stay with them.

522
00:44:30,680 --> 00:44:36,659
This is the core principle.

523
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:39,820
Follow the dominant side.

524
00:44:40,220 --> 00:44:42,659
Don't fight them.

525
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:43,820
Now I'll show you something interesting.

526
00:44:43,820 --> 00:44:46,059
When price is at a key level

527
00:44:46,280 --> 00:44:48,340
And you see these patterns forming

528
00:44:48,340 --> 00:44:50,280
Pin bar, engulfing, whatever

529
00:44:50,500 --> 00:44:59,360
What are they really telling you?

530
00:44:59,360 --> 00:45:03,619
They're telling you about the battle.

531
00:45:03,619 --> 00:45:07,519
Who's winning, who's losing.

532
00:45:07,519 --> 00:45:11,400
A pin bar at resistance - what does it mean?

533
00:45:11,640 --> 00:45:15,719
Bulls tried to break through.

534
00:45:15,719 --> 00:45:24,159
Bears pushed them back hard.

535
00:45:24,159 --> 00:45:27,400
Long wick up, close near the low.

536
00:45:28,559 --> 00:45:33,480
That's the bears saying 'not today'.

537
00:45:34,220 --> 00:45:37,239
They're defending their territory.

538
00:45:37,239 --> 00:45:40,519
Same thing at support.

539
00:45:41,019 --> 00:45:42,219
Pin bar with long wick down

540
00:45:42,840 --> 00:45:47,519
Bulls saying 'nope, not breaking down'.

541
00:45:48,140 --> 00:45:49,780
They're defending.

542
00:45:50,200 --> 00:45:52,280
Engulfing pattern - what is it?

543
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:56,519
One side completely dominates the other.

544
00:45:57,820 --> 00:45:59,139
Bullish engulfing - bulls take over.

545
00:46:00,360 --> 00:46:06,340
Bearish engulfing - bears take control.

546
00:46:07,480 --> 00:46:10,619
See? It's all about the story.

547
00:46:12,260 --> 00:46:16,099
About the battle.

548
00:46:18,440 --> 00:46:20,219
Once you understand this

549
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:26,159
Patterns make so much more sense.

550
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:29,860
You're not just memorizing shapes.

551
00:46:31,820 --> 00:46:37,320
You're understanding what's happening.

552
00:46:37,320 --> 00:46:40,579
Why the pattern formed.

553
00:46:41,220 --> 00:46:44,539
What it means for price action.

554
00:46:45,039 --> 00:46:47,219
This makes you a much better trader.

555
00:46:47,219 --> 00:46:49,800
Now let's look at volume.

556
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:53,119
Volume is like the intensity of the scene.

557
00:46:53,300 --> 00:46:58,880
High volume means lots of action.

558
00:47:00,680 --> 00:47:05,539
Lots of participants.

559
00:47:05,539 --> 00:47:08,719
Strong emotions.

560
00:47:08,719 --> 00:47:12,019
Low volume means not much interest.

561
00:47:12,019 --> 00:47:14,960
Weak commitment.

562
00:47:15,600 --> 00:47:20,760
When you see a breakout with high volume

563
00:47:20,760 --> 00:47:22,960
That's a powerful scene.

564
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:27,019
Lots of energy.

565
00:47:27,340 --> 00:47:42,000
The move is likely to continue.

566
00:47:42,380 --> 00:47:45,019
But a breakout with low volume

567
00:47:45,019 --> 00:47:48,659
Suspicious.

568
00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:52,219
Not much conviction.

569
00:47:52,500 --> 00:47:57,019
Might be a fake breakout.

570
00:47:57,640 --> 00:48:00,719
Price might reverse.

571
00:48:00,719 --> 00:48:03,119
So we watch volume too.

572
00:48:03,940 --> 00:48:07,260
It adds to the story.

573
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:12,900
Tells us how committed each side is.

574
00:48:13,220 --> 00:48:15,980
How much strength they have.

575
00:48:15,980 --> 00:48:21,460
Now let's put it all together.

576
00:48:21,700 --> 00:48:24,400
Reading charts like reading a story.

577
00:48:24,840 --> 00:48:28,260
Step 1: Look at the big picture.

578
00:48:28,980 --> 00:48:31,260
What's the trend?

579
00:48:31,720 --> 00:48:37,000
Which side is dominating?

580
00:48:37,480 --> 00:48:40,880
Step 2: Identify key levels.

581
00:48:41,380 --> 00:48:44,880
Where are the important scenes?

582
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:49,579
Support, resistance, previous highs and lows.

583
00:48:49,780 --> 00:48:53,880
Step 3: Look at the characters.

584
00:48:53,880 --> 00:48:55,940
Which candles are major candles?

585
00:48:55,940 --> 00:49:00,039
Where are they located?

586
00:49:00,860 --> 00:49:04,239
Step 4: Watch the battle.

587
00:49:04,239 --> 00:49:08,019
What's happening at key levels?

588
00:49:08,019 --> 00:49:25,920
Who's winning?

589
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:31,099
Step 5: Check momentum.

590
00:49:31,480 --> 00:49:37,079
Is there strong movement?

591
00:49:37,560 --> 00:49:41,760
Or is it consolidating?

592
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:54,940
Step 6: Consider volume.

593
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:02,619
Is there conviction?

594
00:50:03,559 --> 00:50:14,079
Or is it weak?

595
00:50:14,500 --> 00:50:21,000
Step 7: Make your decision.

596
00:50:23,240 --> 00:50:35,239
Trade with the dominant side.

597
00:50:37,800 --> 00:50:49,599
At the right time.

598
00:50:49,599 --> 00:50:54,860
At key levels.

599
00:50:54,860 --> 00:51:05,219
With confirmation.

600
00:51:05,600 --> 00:51:12,880
This is how professionals do it.

601
00:51:13,540 --> 00:51:18,559
They don't guess.

602
00:51:18,559 --> 00:51:22,059
They read the story.

603
00:51:22,660 --> 00:51:25,500
They understand what's happening.

604
00:51:26,460 --> 00:51:32,179
Then they act.

605
00:51:33,340 --> 00:51:37,440
With the flow.

606
00:51:38,060 --> 00:51:42,559
Not against it.

607
00:51:43,300 --> 00:51:49,059
Now I'll show you some real examples.

608
00:51:50,920 --> 00:51:57,360
So you can see this in action.

609
00:51:57,660 --> 00:52:01,980
Look at this chart here.

610
00:52:03,100 --> 00:52:03,960
First, what's the trend?

611
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:11,099
Clearly uptrend.

612
00:52:11,980 --> 00:52:16,039
Higher highs, higher lows.

613
00:52:17,220 --> 00:52:21,719
Bulls are in control.

614
00:52:21,719 --> 00:52:24,659
Now where are the key levels?

615
00:52:26,620 --> 00:52:30,340
Here's a previous resistance.

616
00:52:32,039 --> 00:52:34,360
Price broke through it.

617
00:52:34,360 --> 00:52:39,019
Now it should become support.

618
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:42,139
Let's see if it does.

619
00:52:43,340 --> 00:52:45,199
Price comes back down.

620
00:52:46,040 --> 00:52:49,000
Tests this level.

621
00:52:50,140 --> 00:52:54,880
What happens?

622
00:52:56,240 --> 00:52:59,559
See these candles?

623
00:53:01,900 --> 00:53:08,019
Green candles defending.

624
00:53:08,019 --> 00:53:12,679
Bulls saying 'nope, not breaking down'.

625
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:17,880
Price bounces back up.

626
00:53:18,620 --> 00:53:22,900
The level held.

627
00:53:24,340 --> 00:53:30,840
Bulls are still in control.

628
00:53:30,840 --> 00:53:33,579
What do we do?

629
00:53:33,579 --> 00:53:35,820
We buy here.

630
00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:41,059
We go with the bulls.

631
00:53:41,260 --> 00:53:44,199
We trade at this key level.

632
00:53:44,940 --> 00:53:46,800
Where we have confirmation.

633
00:53:47,059 --> 00:53:48,679
See how clean that is?

634
00:53:49,400 --> 00:53:51,880
We're not guessing.

635
00:53:52,820 --> 00:53:55,099
We're reading the story.

636
00:53:56,140 --> 00:53:57,159
The story told us bulls are in control.

637
00:53:58,380 --> 00:53:59,920
The level held.

638
00:53:59,920 --> 00:54:02,340
So we go long.

639
00:54:02,540 --> 00:54:08,780
Simple.

640
00:54:11,220 --> 00:54:15,719
Now look at another example.

641
00:54:15,719 --> 00:54:17,699
This time a downtrend.

642
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:22,659
Lower lows, lower highs.

643
00:54:23,380 --> 00:54:27,139
Bears dominating.

644
00:54:32,559 --> 00:54:38,659
Previous support becomes resistance.

645
00:54:39,900 --> 00:54:41,340
Price comes back up to test it.

646
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:48,639
What happens?

647
00:54:49,539 --> 00:54:51,360
Red candles defending.

648
00:54:52,180 --> 00:54:56,440
Bears saying 'not breaking up'.

649
00:54:57,079 --> 00:55:00,920
Price gets rejected.

650
00:55:00,920 --> 00:55:04,920
Goes back down.

651
00:55:05,340 --> 00:55:08,679
So we short here.

652
00:55:08,900 --> 00:55:11,500
We go with the bears.

653
00:55:12,700 --> 00:55:16,679
Again, simple.

654
00:55:17,420 --> 00:55:21,460
Read the story.

655
00:55:24,460 --> 00:55:28,300
Trade accordingly.

656
00:55:29,120 --> 00:55:32,800
This is what I want you to understand.

657
00:55:32,800 --> 00:55:38,300
Trading doesn't have to be complicated.

658
00:55:38,300 --> 00:55:41,699
You don't need 50 indicators.

659
00:55:41,699 --> 00:55:46,099
You don't need complex algorithms.

660
00:55:46,099 --> 00:55:49,360
You just need to read the story.

661
00:55:49,360 --> 00:55:54,179
Understand what's happening.

662
00:55:55,660 --> 00:55:58,199
See who's in control.

663
00:55:58,199 --> 00:56:00,820
Then trade with them.

664
00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:04,239
That's it.

665
00:56:04,579 --> 00:56:05,900
Everything else is just details.

666
00:56:07,559 --> 00:56:10,019
Now, some of you might be thinking

667
00:56:12,120 --> 00:56:16,579
'But what about fundamentals?'

668
00:56:16,579 --> 00:56:21,559
'What about news?'

669
00:56:21,559 --> 00:56:23,360
'What about economic data?'

670
00:56:25,240 --> 00:56:28,019
Here's the thing.

671
00:56:29,100 --> 00:56:32,440
All of that is already in the chart.

672
00:56:32,980 --> 00:56:35,159
The chart is the ultimate truth.

673
00:56:35,740 --> 00:56:37,619
It shows what everyone thinks.

674
00:56:38,760 --> 00:56:41,300
What everyone's doing.

675
00:56:42,280 --> 00:56:42,800
All the news, all the data

676
00:56:46,360 --> 00:56:48,739
It's all reflected in price.

677
00:56:48,739 --> 00:56:53,440
So we don't need to know the news.

678
00:56:53,440 --> 00:56:59,000
We just need to read what the price is telling us.

679
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:01,559
The chart never lies.

680
00:57:02,920 --> 00:57:12,780
It shows us exactly what's happening.

681
00:57:12,780 --> 00:57:16,539
Who's buying, who's selling.

682
00:57:22,180 --> 00:57:30,539
Who's winning, who's losing.

683
00:57:30,539 --> 00:57:33,239
That's all we need to know.

684
00:57:33,239 --> 00:57:36,440
Now let's talk about risk management.

685
00:57:37,660 --> 00:57:42,519
This is crucial.

686
00:57:42,519 --> 00:57:48,519
You can read the story perfectly

687
00:57:48,519 --> 00:57:53,360
But if you don't manage risk

688
00:57:53,360 --> 00:57:56,260
You'll still lose.

689
00:57:59,840 --> 00:58:04,380
So here's how we do it.

690
00:58:04,559 --> 00:58:09,360
When we enter a trade

691
00:58:09,360 --> 00:58:11,340
We always use a stop loss.

692
00:58:11,340 --> 00:58:14,579
Always.

693
00:58:14,579 --> 00:58:17,019
No exceptions.

694
00:58:19,400 --> 00:58:21,900
Where do we put it?

695
00:58:22,560 --> 00:58:30,199
At a logical level.

696
00:58:30,199 --> 00:58:34,400
If we're buying at support

697
00:58:48,720 --> 00:58:51,940
Stop goes below support.

698
00:58:51,940 --> 00:58:57,500
If we're selling at resistance

699
00:58:57,840 --> 00:59:02,360
Stop goes above resistance.

700
00:59:05,220 --> 00:59:16,780
Why?

701
00:59:17,500 --> 00:59:27,380
Because if our story is wrong

702
00:59:27,380 --> 00:59:30,639
If the level breaks

703
00:59:30,880 --> 00:59:34,380
We get out immediately.

704
00:59:34,380 --> 00:59:39,260
We don't hope it comes back.

705
00:59:39,260 --> 00:59:44,579
We don't average down.

706
00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:56,380
We just exit.

707
00:59:57,640 --> 01:00:07,440
Accept we were wrong.

708
01:00:09,560 --> 01:00:17,880
And move on.

709
01:00:21,340 --> 01:00:22,579
This keeps our losses small.

710
01:00:24,680 --> 01:00:25,679
And our account safe.

711
01:00:26,100 --> 01:00:29,179
Now for profit targets.

712
01:00:29,179 --> 01:00:30,099
Where do we take profit?

713
01:00:34,640 --> 01:00:36,619
At the next logical level.

714
01:00:36,619 --> 01:00:37,780
If we're buying at support

715
01:00:37,780 --> 01:00:39,360
We take profit at resistance.

716
01:00:39,740 --> 01:00:40,159
If we're selling at resistance

717
01:00:41,340 --> 01:00:42,780
We take profit at support.

718
01:00:42,780 --> 01:00:45,900
Or we trail our stop.

719
01:00:45,900 --> 01:00:48,679
Let the winners run.

720
01:00:49,700 --> 01:00:51,579
As long as the story continues.

721
01:00:52,320 --> 01:00:56,280
As long as our side is dominating.

722
01:00:56,559 --> 01:00:57,559
We stay in.

723
01:00:58,240 --> 01:01:00,380
But when signs change

724
01:01:00,800 --> 01:01:03,500
When the story shifts

725
01:01:03,960 --> 01:01:05,460
We exit.

726
01:01:06,079 --> 01:01:10,639
This is how we maximize profits.

727
01:01:11,680 --> 01:01:14,460
We let good trades run.

728
01:01:17,600 --> 01:01:22,940
And cut bad trades quickly.

729
01:01:24,660 --> 01:01:28,019
Simple risk management.

730
01:01:30,820 --> 01:01:36,199
But incredibly effective.

731
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:39,500
Now let's talk about psychology.

732
01:01:42,600 --> 01:01:43,480
This is where most traders fail.

733
01:01:44,100 --> 01:01:49,239
Not because they can't read charts.

734
01:01:49,980 --> 01:01:50,739
But because they can't control emotions.

735
01:01:55,420 --> 01:01:56,219
Fear and greed.

736
01:01:56,880 --> 01:02:09,639
These kill traders.

737
01:02:11,680 --> 01:02:17,400
Fear makes you exit too early.

738
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:26,440
Greed makes you hold too long.

739
01:02:28,020 --> 01:02:47,219
How do we avoid this?

740
01:02:47,219 --> 01:02:52,519
By following the story.

741
01:02:52,920 --> 01:02:56,500
The story keeps us objective.

742
01:02:59,560 --> 01:03:03,559
We're not guessing.

743
01:03:04,600 --> 01:03:15,420
We're not hoping.

744
01:03:16,940 --> 01:03:33,539
We're just reading what's there.

745
01:03:33,539 --> 01:03:35,079
If the story says bulls are winning

746
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:36,920
We trade with bulls.

747
01:03:37,519 --> 01:03:38,760
Regardless of how we feel.

748
01:03:38,760 --> 01:03:40,539
If the story says bears are winning

749
01:03:41,540 --> 01:03:42,280
We trade with bears.

750
01:03:42,800 --> 01:03:44,679
Our emotions don't matter.

751
01:03:44,679 --> 01:03:47,380
Only the story matters.

752
01:03:48,079 --> 01:03:48,519
This removes emotion.

753
01:03:48,519 --> 01:03:50,079
Makes trading mechanical.

754
01:03:50,740 --> 01:03:52,219
In a good way.

755
01:03:52,740 --> 01:03:56,500
We become like robots.

756
01:03:56,500 --> 01:04:00,059
Following a system.

757
01:04:00,059 --> 01:04:05,460
Not emotional.

758
01:04:06,260 --> 01:04:09,099
This is how you survive long-term.

759
01:04:09,099 --> 01:04:12,300
So remember.

760
01:04:13,380 --> 01:04:18,340
Read charts like reading a story.

761
01:04:19,780 --> 01:04:24,920
Look at the big picture first.

762
01:04:25,320 --> 01:04:39,079
Identify key levels.

763
01:04:41,620 --> 01:04:43,659
Watch the major candles.

764
01:04:43,980 --> 01:04:45,940
See who's winning.

765
01:04:46,500 --> 01:04:49,579
Trade with them.

766
01:04:49,579 --> 01:04:51,780
Manage your risk.

767
01:04:52,640 --> 01:04:56,639
Control your emotions.

768
01:04:58,180 --> 01:05:01,380
Follow the story.

769
01:05:01,600 --> 01:05:03,599
That's it.

770
01:05:04,180 --> 01:05:06,159
That's all you need.

771
01:05:08,420 --> 01:05:09,840
Now let me show you one more thing.

772
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:15,840
Multiple timeframe analysis.

773
01:05:15,840 --> 01:05:31,360
This is powerful.

774
01:05:31,360 --> 01:05:35,519
We look at the daily chart first.

775
01:05:35,519 --> 01:05:38,500
What's the main story?

776
01:05:40,280 --> 01:05:45,639
Uptrend, downtrend, sideways?

777
01:05:45,639 --> 01:05:52,019
This is our guide.

778
01:05:53,079 --> 01:05:59,059
Then we zoom to 4-hour chart.

779
01:05:59,940 --> 01:06:12,300
Same question.

780
01:06:14,480 --> 01:06:20,559
What's happening here?

781
01:06:21,840 --> 01:06:25,199
Is it aligned with daily?

782
01:06:26,460 --> 01:06:29,480
If yes, strong confirmation.

783
01:06:29,980 --> 01:06:33,460
If no, we wait.

784
01:06:39,080 --> 01:06:40,719
Then 1-hour chart.

785
01:06:42,180 --> 01:06:46,900
For entry timing.

786
01:06:47,820 --> 01:06:51,880
We only trade when all timeframes agree.

787
01:06:53,540 --> 01:06:59,079
Daily uptrend.

788
01:06:59,820 --> 01:07:03,280
4-hour uptrend.

789
01:07:03,820 --> 01:07:06,300
1-hour shows pullback to support.

790
01:07:06,300 --> 01:07:09,880
We buy there.

791
01:07:09,880 --> 01:07:13,019
This gives us the highest probability.

792
01:07:13,019 --> 01:07:14,840
All timeframes telling the same story.

793
01:07:14,840 --> 01:07:15,980
All agreeing on direction.

794
01:07:15,980 --> 01:07:19,820
This is when we have confidence.

795
01:07:20,300 --> 01:07:21,980
This is when we go big.

796
01:07:23,200 --> 01:07:27,159
Not big like crazy.

797
01:07:27,480 --> 01:07:31,400
But with proper position sizing.

798
01:07:32,980 --> 01:07:35,099
We increase our risk slightly.

799
01:07:35,620 --> 01:07:51,960
Because probability is high.

800
01:07:51,960 --> 01:07:58,639
When timeframes don't align.

801
01:07:59,480 --> 01:08:05,599
We reduce position size.

802
01:08:05,599 --> 01:08:09,280
Or don't trade at all.

803
01:08:10,160 --> 01:08:18,739
We wait for alignment.

804
01:08:18,739 --> 01:08:27,159
Patience is key.

805
01:08:27,740 --> 01:08:31,680
Don't force trades.

806
01:08:31,680 --> 01:08:35,960
Wait for the right setup.

807
01:08:36,260 --> 01:08:42,220
The right story.

808
01:08:42,539 --> 01:08:45,619
Then execute.

809
01:08:47,160 --> 01:08:52,600
This discipline separates winners from losers.

810
01:08:53,520 --> 01:08:58,819
Winners wait for good setups.

811
01:08:58,819 --> 01:09:01,180
Losers trade everything.

812
01:09:01,180 --> 01:09:03,880
Winners are selective.

813
01:09:03,880 --> 01:09:07,300
Quality over quantity.

814
01:09:07,300 --> 01:09:12,880
A few good trades per week.

815
01:09:13,340 --> 01:09:16,180
Is better than many mediocre ones.

816
01:09:16,180 --> 01:09:18,140
Remember that.

817
01:09:18,980 --> 01:09:22,260
Now let me show you this chart.

818
01:09:23,100 --> 01:09:27,340
See this consolidation?

819
01:09:28,260 --> 01:09:34,560
Price going sideways.

820
01:09:34,560 --> 01:09:40,979
What's the story saying?

821
01:09:43,640 --> 01:09:47,340
Bulls and bears are evenly matched.

822
01:09:47,340 --> 01:09:50,000
Neither side can win yet.

823
01:09:51,159 --> 01:09:53,579
What do we do?

824
01:09:53,579 --> 01:09:56,960
We wait.

825
01:09:57,460 --> 01:09:59,779
We don't trade in the middle of consolidation.

826
01:10:00,100 --> 01:10:04,220
Too risky.

827
01:10:04,520 --> 01:10:09,159
No clear direction.

828
01:10:09,819 --> 01:10:13,279
We wait for the breakout.

829
01:10:13,700 --> 01:10:20,600
Wait for one side to win.

830
01:10:20,900 --> 01:10:24,560
Then we trade with them.

831
01:10:26,579 --> 01:10:29,960
See? Patience.

832
01:10:31,020 --> 01:10:34,279
Not every moment is tradeable.

833
01:10:34,279 --> 01:10:38,800
Sometimes the story is unclear.

834
01:10:39,880 --> 01:10:44,119
That's okay.

835
01:10:44,920 --> 01:10:50,079
We wait for clarity.

836
01:10:50,079 --> 01:10:54,260
Better to miss a trade

837
01:10:54,260 --> 01:10:59,220
Than to take a bad one.

838
01:10:59,880 --> 01:11:03,279
This mindset is crucial.

839
01:11:05,400 --> 01:11:06,439
It protects your capital.

840
01:11:16,960 --> 01:11:29,659
Keeps you in the game.

841
01:11:29,659 --> 01:11:39,600
So you can trade another day.

842
01:11:39,600 --> 01:11:48,939
Capital preservation is number one.

843
01:11:50,980 --> 01:11:56,319
Before making money

844
01:11:58,980 --> 01:12:05,939
Don't lose money.

845
01:12:06,100 --> 01:12:10,939
That's the rule.

846
01:12:10,939 --> 01:12:16,279
Now let's see another example.

847
01:12:17,619 --> 01:12:20,479
This is a perfect setup.

848
01:12:22,079 --> 01:12:26,319
Daily uptrend.

849
01:12:26,680 --> 01:12:31,099
4-hour uptrend.

850
01:12:31,100 --> 01:12:35,060
Price pulls back to support on 1-hour.

851
01:12:35,060 --> 01:12:38,260
See these candles?

852
01:12:39,560 --> 01:12:43,020
Major candles defending support.

853
01:12:44,500 --> 01:12:45,920
All timeframes aligned.

854
01:12:45,920 --> 01:12:47,619
Perfect setup.

855
01:12:48,220 --> 01:12:51,180
We buy here.

856
01:12:51,180 --> 01:12:53,680
Stop below support.

857
01:12:54,760 --> 01:12:55,159
Target at next resistance.

858
01:12:56,300 --> 01:13:06,060
This is a textbook trade.

859
01:13:07,579 --> 01:13:13,640
High probability.

860
01:13:14,980 --> 01:13:19,739
All conditions met.

861
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:21,600
This is what we wait for.

862
01:13:25,900 --> 01:13:28,560
These setups don't come every day.

863
01:13:28,560 --> 01:13:32,560
Maybe a few times per week.

864
01:13:33,460 --> 01:13:35,399
But when they do

865
01:13:35,780 --> 01:13:38,220
They're golden.

866
01:13:38,220 --> 01:13:42,680
High win rate.

867
01:13:44,300 --> 01:13:48,579
Good risk-reward ratio.

868
01:13:48,880 --> 01:13:56,319
This is what professionals trade.

869
01:13:56,800 --> 01:14:05,460
Not random setups.

870
01:14:05,880 --> 01:14:08,140
But perfect stories.

871
01:14:08,539 --> 01:14:10,159
When everything lines up.

872
01:14:10,159 --> 01:14:11,680
When the message is clear.

873
01:14:11,920 --> 01:14:12,880
That's when we act.

874
01:14:13,199 --> 01:14:15,840
Now I want you to practice this.

875
01:14:15,840 --> 01:14:17,720
Go look at charts.

876
01:14:17,980 --> 01:14:19,840
Any chart, any pair.

877
01:14:20,420 --> 01:14:25,100
And read the story.

878
01:14:25,800 --> 01:14:31,819
Don't trade yet.

879
01:14:31,819 --> 01:14:36,560
Just read.

880
01:14:36,560 --> 01:14:38,439
What's the trend?

881
01:14:39,840 --> 01:14:41,859
Where are key levels?

882
01:14:47,460 --> 01:14:47,779
Who's dominating?

883
01:14:48,500 --> 01:14:48,939
What's happening at key scenes?

884
01:14:50,420 --> 01:14:52,260
Practice this.

885
01:14:52,260 --> 01:14:54,359
Every day.

886
01:14:55,300 --> 01:14:56,600
Until it becomes second nature.

887
01:14:57,380 --> 01:15:00,300
Until you can read charts

888
01:15:00,300 --> 01:15:02,439
Like you read books.

889
01:15:02,439 --> 01:15:08,600
Naturally.

890
01:15:08,600 --> 01:15:18,439
Without thinking.

891
01:15:18,820 --> 01:15:22,260
This takes time.

892
01:15:22,760 --> 01:15:26,640
Don't rush it.

893
01:15:26,940 --> 01:15:30,060
But keep practicing.

894
01:15:30,440 --> 01:15:33,140
And you'll get there.

895
01:15:34,440 --> 01:15:36,579
You'll see charts differently.

896
01:15:37,100 --> 01:15:40,800
Not as random candles.

897
01:15:40,800 --> 01:15:44,439
But as a story.

898
01:15:44,439 --> 01:15:48,899
A battle between bulls and bears.

899
01:15:49,340 --> 01:15:56,520
And you'll know who's winning.

900
01:15:58,140 --> 01:16:01,880
That's when trading becomes easy.

901
01:16:01,880 --> 01:16:06,880
Not complicated anymore.

902
01:16:07,400 --> 01:16:11,020
Just natural.

903
01:16:11,739 --> 01:16:16,319
Like breathing.

904
01:16:16,319 --> 01:16:25,020
That's the goal.

905
01:16:25,240 --> 01:16:29,720
Okay, so to summarize.

906
01:16:30,079 --> 01:16:34,380
Reading charts like reading a story.

907
01:16:36,480 --> 01:16:40,520
This is the key concept.

908
01:16:41,560 --> 01:16:44,399
Everything else flows from this.

909
01:16:45,119 --> 01:16:50,939
Understand the narrative.

910
01:16:51,880 --> 01:16:57,100
See the characters.

911
01:16:57,100 --> 01:17:02,779
Watch the plot unfold.

912
01:17:07,600 --> 01:17:12,060
Identify the key scenes.

913
01:17:12,500 --> 01:17:16,600
Know who's dominating.

914
01:17:17,340 --> 01:17:20,939
Trade with them.

915
01:17:21,360 --> 01:17:23,939
Manage your risk properly.

916
01:17:23,939 --> 01:17:27,260
Control your emotions.

917
01:17:27,260 --> 01:17:31,079
Be patient.

918
01:17:33,380 --> 01:17:39,359
Wait for the right setups.

919
01:17:42,819 --> 01:17:46,579
And execute when everything aligns.

920
01:17:48,219 --> 01:17:52,020
That's professional trading.

921
01:17:53,159 --> 01:17:57,119
That's how you survive long-term.

922
01:17:57,119 --> 01:17:58,460
That's how you make consistent profits.

923
01:17:59,100 --> 01:18:01,239
Not by guessing.

924
01:18:01,480 --> 01:18:02,279
Not by hoping.

925
01:18:02,600 --> 01:18:05,300
But by reading the story correctly.

926
01:18:05,840 --> 01:18:07,159
And acting on what you see.

927
01:18:07,159 --> 01:18:08,680
Not on what you want to see.

928
01:18:09,319 --> 01:18:11,560
But what's actually there.

929
01:18:12,239 --> 01:18:13,920
The truth in the chart.

930
01:18:17,180 --> 01:18:17,720
That's what matters.

931
01:18:18,079 --> 01:18:19,000
Now before we finish

932
01:18:19,279 --> 01:18:21,500
Let me show you a few more examples.

933
01:18:22,360 --> 01:18:24,899
Real trading examples.

934
01:18:25,220 --> 01:18:30,420
So you can see this method in action.

935
01:18:31,440 --> 01:18:36,500
Look at this chart.

936
01:18:36,500 --> 01:18:38,680
What do you see?

937
01:18:40,360 --> 01:18:41,939
Take a moment.

938
01:18:43,180 --> 01:18:44,939
Read the story.

939
01:18:44,939 --> 01:18:48,260
What's happening here?

940
01:18:48,260 --> 01:18:51,560
Think about it.

941
01:18:52,460 --> 01:18:56,939
Okay, let me tell you what I see.

942
01:18:56,939 --> 01:19:01,439
First, overall trend.

943
01:19:01,439 --> 01:19:04,420
Price making lower lows and lower highs.

944
01:19:04,420 --> 01:19:07,619
Downtrend.

945
01:19:07,940 --> 01:19:11,220
Bears in control.

946
01:19:12,920 --> 01:19:15,380
Now look at this level.

947
01:19:16,360 --> 01:19:18,460
Previous support, right?

948
01:19:18,460 --> 01:19:20,720
Price broke through it.

949
01:19:21,440 --> 01:19:23,960
Now comes back to test it.

950
01:19:27,079 --> 01:19:28,279
Should act as resistance now.

951
01:19:31,079 --> 01:19:37,220
Let's see what happens.

952
01:19:38,220 --> 01:19:44,579
Look, red candles.

953
01:19:44,579 --> 01:19:53,800
Bears defending this level.

954
01:19:54,779 --> 01:19:57,539
Price gets rejected.

955
01:19:58,320 --> 01:20:02,720
Can't break through.

956
01:20:02,720 --> 01:20:06,800
Goes back down.

957
01:20:06,800 --> 01:20:23,779
This confirms the downtrend.

958
01:20:23,779 --> 01:20:30,500
Bears still in control.

959
01:20:30,500 --> 01:20:36,039
What do we do?

960
01:20:36,039 --> 01:20:40,560
We short here.

961
01:20:40,560 --> 01:20:43,840
At this resistance.

962
01:20:44,920 --> 01:20:50,140
With stop above.

963
01:20:50,880 --> 01:20:57,159
Target at next support.

964
01:20:57,159 --> 01:21:05,060
Simple trade.

965
01:21:08,279 --> 01:21:13,520
Following the story.

966
01:21:16,780 --> 01:21:20,199
Trading with the bears.

967
01:21:21,260 --> 01:21:24,159
Not against them.

968
01:21:25,900 --> 01:21:26,760
See how logical that is?

969
01:21:31,820 --> 01:21:38,140
When you read the story

970
01:21:38,140 --> 01:21:44,140
Trading decisions become obvious.

971
01:21:44,840 --> 01:21:48,519
You're not confused.

972
01:21:49,760 --> 01:21:54,260
You know what to do.

973
01:21:54,600 --> 01:21:59,500
Because the chart tells you.

974
01:21:59,980 --> 01:22:02,760
Another example.

975
01:22:04,840 --> 01:22:08,979
This time uptrend.

976
01:22:08,979 --> 01:22:13,659
Higher highs, higher lows.

977
01:22:14,500 --> 01:22:18,699
Bulls dominating.

978
01:22:18,699 --> 01:22:24,439
Price pulls back to a previous high.

979
01:22:27,340 --> 01:22:32,020
Which should now be support.

980
01:22:32,020 --> 01:22:34,920
Let's see.

981
01:22:35,600 --> 01:22:39,279
Green candles appear.

982
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:42,680
Bulls defending.

983
01:22:42,680 --> 01:22:44,659
Price bounces up.

984
01:22:44,659 --> 01:22:46,560
Support holds.

985
01:22:46,560 --> 01:22:49,000
Uptrend continues.

986
01:22:49,220 --> 01:22:50,680
We buy here.

987
01:22:50,680 --> 01:22:52,260
At this support.

988
01:22:52,260 --> 01:22:53,140
Stop below.

989
01:22:54,060 --> 01:22:56,220
Target at next resistance.

990
01:22:56,220 --> 01:22:57,460
Again, simple.

991
01:22:57,460 --> 01:22:59,460
Following the story.

992
01:23:00,480 --> 01:23:02,359
Trading with the bulls.

993
01:23:02,359 --> 01:23:04,520
See the pattern?

994
01:23:05,020 --> 01:23:08,600
It's always the same.

995
01:23:08,600 --> 01:23:11,239
Read the trend.

996
01:23:11,239 --> 01:23:14,500
Find key levels.

997
01:23:14,500 --> 01:23:16,779
Wait for price to come there.

998
01:23:16,779 --> 01:23:19,779
See who defends.

999
01:23:21,140 --> 01:23:25,239
Trade with them.

1000
01:23:25,239 --> 01:23:29,239
That's the method.

1001
01:23:30,440 --> 01:23:46,600
Now, is it really this easy?

1002
01:23:46,600 --> 01:23:47,720
Yes and no.

1003
01:23:49,060 --> 01:23:51,359
The concept is simple.

1004
01:23:51,359 --> 01:23:53,140
But execution takes practice.

1005
01:23:53,619 --> 01:23:54,020
You need to train your eyes.

1006
01:23:55,140 --> 01:23:56,600
To see the story.

1007
01:23:56,780 --> 01:23:59,399
To recognize the patterns.

1008
01:23:59,399 --> 01:24:01,380
To understand what's happening.

1009
01:24:01,640 --> 01:24:03,920
This doesn't happen overnight.

1010
01:24:04,199 --> 01:24:05,520
It takes time.

1011
01:24:06,239 --> 01:24:07,619
It takes screen time.

1012
01:24:07,619 --> 01:24:16,640
Looking at charts every day.

1013
01:24:17,500 --> 01:24:23,079
Practicing reading the story.

1014
01:24:23,900 --> 01:24:28,539
But once you get it

1015
01:24:28,539 --> 01:24:31,800
It's yours forever.

1016
01:24:31,800 --> 01:24:36,899
It becomes intuitive.

1017
01:24:36,899 --> 01:24:53,060
You'll see it instantly.

1018
01:24:53,060 --> 01:24:59,720
No thinking required.

1019
01:25:04,140 --> 01:25:09,619
Just like reading.

1020
01:25:12,579 --> 01:25:15,739
You don't think about each word.

1021
01:25:19,460 --> 01:25:20,079
You just read.

1022
01:25:25,320 --> 01:25:25,720
Same with charts.

1023
01:25:25,720 --> 01:25:31,640
You'll just see the story.

1024
01:25:35,600 --> 01:25:38,439
Automatically.

1025
01:25:39,739 --> 01:25:41,100
That's the goal.

1026
01:25:43,440 --> 01:25:48,199
That's what we're aiming for.

1027
01:25:51,340 --> 01:25:52,579
So keep practicing.

1028
01:25:55,420 --> 01:26:01,739
Don't give up.

1029
01:26:03,820 --> 01:26:07,359
Even if it's confusing at first.

1030
01:26:15,720 --> 01:26:19,199
It will click.

1031
01:26:21,360 --> 01:26:25,699
I promise.

1032
01:26:26,560 --> 01:26:28,399
Now let's look at risk-reward ratio.

1033
01:26:28,739 --> 01:26:30,539
This is important.

1034
01:26:33,039 --> 01:26:33,720
Every trade should have good risk-reward.

1035
01:26:38,840 --> 01:26:40,899
At least 1:2.

1036
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:45,260
Risk 1 to make 2.

1037
01:26:47,840 --> 01:26:48,739
Or better.

1038
01:26:49,260 --> 01:26:51,659
How do we calculate this?

1039
01:26:52,280 --> 01:26:54,159
Entry to stop is our risk.

1040
01:26:54,159 --> 01:26:55,539
Entry to target is our reward.

1041
01:26:55,539 --> 01:26:59,079
If risk is 50 pips

1042
01:27:00,039 --> 01:27:02,100
Reward should be 100 pips minimum.

1043
01:27:02,100 --> 01:27:03,800
Or 1:2 ratio.

1044
01:27:03,800 --> 01:27:05,739
This means even if we win only half our trades

1045
01:27:07,619 --> 01:27:08,399
We still make money overall.

1046
01:27:10,579 --> 01:27:12,420
This is crucial.

1047
01:27:15,200 --> 01:27:21,640
Good risk-reward protects us.

1048
01:27:22,119 --> 01:27:27,180
Allows us to lose and still profit.

1049
01:27:28,579 --> 01:27:37,380
Never take trades with bad risk-reward.

1050
01:27:38,640 --> 01:27:40,619
No matter how good the setup looks.

1051
01:27:41,060 --> 01:27:42,899
If the risk-reward is bad

1052
01:27:43,300 --> 01:27:47,000
Skip it.

1053
01:27:48,539 --> 01:27:51,180
Wait for better opportunity.

1054
01:27:51,180 --> 01:27:52,979
This discipline is key.

1055
01:27:53,260 --> 01:28:07,359
Now let's talk about win rate.

1056
01:28:09,239 --> 01:28:12,680
You don't need high win rate.

1057
01:28:12,680 --> 01:28:17,760
50% is enough.

1058
01:28:19,100 --> 01:28:21,000
With 1:2 risk-reward.

1059
01:28:23,480 --> 01:28:26,159
You profit with 50% wins.

1060
01:28:27,340 --> 01:28:28,979
Let me show you the math.

1061
01:28:30,360 --> 01:28:31,659
10 trades, 5 wins, 5 losses.

1062
01:28:34,460 --> 01:28:35,579
Each win makes 100, each loss costs 50.

1063
01:28:36,560 --> 01:28:58,420
Total wins: 500.

1064
01:28:59,900 --> 01:29:04,220
Total losses: 250.

1065
01:29:04,920 --> 01:29:08,840
Net profit: 250.

1066
01:29:08,840 --> 01:29:12,939
See?

1067
01:29:12,939 --> 01:29:16,760
50% win rate is profitable.

1068
01:29:17,800 --> 01:29:18,340
With good risk-reward.

1069
01:29:21,820 --> 01:29:25,939
So don't stress about win rate.

1070
01:29:25,939 --> 01:29:28,819
Focus on risk-reward instead.

1071
01:29:29,159 --> 01:29:30,399
This changes everything.

1072
01:29:30,399 --> 01:29:31,840
You don't need to be right all the time.

1073
01:29:33,039 --> 01:29:35,539
Just need good risk-reward.

1074
01:29:37,340 --> 01:29:46,739
And consistent execution.

1075
01:29:53,200 --> 01:30:00,100
That's the secret.

1076
01:30:00,720 --> 01:30:01,939
Professional traders know this.

1077
01:30:02,680 --> 01:30:06,640
They lose all the time.

1078
01:30:06,640 --> 01:30:11,000
But they still make money.

1079
01:30:11,300 --> 01:30:15,000
Because of risk-reward.

1080
01:30:15,680 --> 01:30:16,359
Remember that.

1081
01:30:19,060 --> 01:30:23,800
It's not about being right.

1082
01:30:23,800 --> 01:30:27,140
It's about risk management.

1083
01:30:28,079 --> 01:30:30,939
Okay, we're almost at the end.

1084
01:30:33,020 --> 01:30:38,760
Let me give you final thoughts.

1085
01:30:39,480 --> 01:30:45,539
Trading is a journey.

1086
01:30:46,480 --> 01:30:49,979
Not a destination.

1087
01:30:51,659 --> 01:30:56,439
You never stop learning.

1088
01:30:58,220 --> 01:31:07,859
Markets always changing.

1089
01:31:08,159 --> 01:31:14,100
Always evolving.

1090
01:31:14,440 --> 01:31:17,260
We need to adapt.

1091
01:31:18,060 --> 01:31:22,439
But the principles stay the same.

1092
01:31:23,640 --> 01:31:28,260
Reading the story.

1093
01:31:28,860 --> 01:31:32,439
Understanding flow.

1094
01:31:33,980 --> 01:31:42,939
Trading with dominant side.

1095
01:31:43,380 --> 01:31:49,560
Managing risk properly.

1096
01:31:49,560 --> 01:31:55,899
These never change.

1097
01:31:57,079 --> 01:32:00,380
Master these principles.

1098
01:32:00,380 --> 01:32:03,960
And you'll succeed.

1099
01:32:06,100 --> 01:32:08,380
No matter what market.

1100
01:32:10,079 --> 01:32:11,899
No matter what timeframe.

1101
01:32:13,680 --> 01:32:14,300
These principles work everywhere.

1102
01:32:17,440 --> 01:32:19,100
Forex, stocks, crypto.

1103
01:32:24,079 --> 01:32:24,899
All the same.

1104
01:32:30,520 --> 01:32:30,840
Because it's human psychology.

1105
01:32:31,920 --> 01:32:34,180
Fear and greed.

1106
01:32:36,460 --> 01:32:37,760
Bulls and bears.

1107
01:32:39,100 --> 01:32:43,060
The story repeats.

1108
01:32:43,779 --> 01:32:45,880
Just different names.

1109
01:32:47,940 --> 01:32:50,260
Different timeframes.

1110
01:32:53,700 --> 01:32:54,079
But same principles.

1111
01:32:54,980 --> 01:32:58,319
So master this method.

1112
01:32:59,119 --> 01:33:01,079
And you have a skill for life.

1113
01:33:03,100 --> 01:33:05,779

01:47:43,539 --> 01:47:49,899
Just a few more things to cover.

1297
01:47:50,300 --> 01:47:56,079
Some final tips.

1298
01:47:56,079 --> 01:48:03,760
And we'll be done.

1299
01:48:06,100 --> 01:48:07,920
Stay with me.

1300
01:48:10,100 --> 01:48:15,140
Almost there.

1301
01:48:15,140 --> 01:48:18,680
Still not very impressive.

1302
01:48:18,680 --> 01:48:26,260
But going against it would be more concerning.

1303
01:48:26,960 --> 01:48:28,220
With this candle here.

1304
01:48:30,579 --> 01:48:32,220
It still seems to have opposing momentum.

1305
01:48:32,579 --> 01:48:38,859
So it's rising, but the upward momentum is decreasing. True, it has to hit this major candle at this level.

1306
01:48:39,860 --> 01:48:45,920
If it breaks through here, the momentum will still be there to push it higher.

1307
01:48:46,819 --> 01:48:50,020
Let's see if it can make it.

1308
01:48:52,739 --> 01:48:56,720
Ah, here it comes. Starting to show some strength. See that? Red's trying to push down.

1309
01:48:56,940 --> 01:49:02,100
Pushing down, but in the end it rises and closes as a decent-sized candle.

1310
01:49:02,500 --> 01:49:04,979
So there's strength here. The major candle's broken now.

1311
01:49:04,979 --> 01:49:06,979
I'm switching this slightly. I'm moving it to this tail.

1312
01:49:08,699 --> 01:49:12,819
See? It'll battle around this tail now. Here, they're trying.

1313
01:49:12,819 --> 01:49:13,939
Will they break the tail?

1314
01:49:17,720 --> 01:49:22,539
Turns out yes. Strong momentum coming in. So this zone's been reclaimed.

1315
01:49:23,340 --> 01:49:27,239
Remove it. It's reclaimed. How much has been reclaimed?

1316
01:49:28,579 --> 01:49:31,479
Then it runs out of steam up top. See that?

1317
01:49:32,880 --> 01:49:35,020
Losing momentum at the top. Will it pull back down?

1318
01:49:38,240 --> 01:49:41,680
Might not remove it yet. I'll keep it for now. Forgot that it needs to be resistance.

1319
01:49:41,680 --> 01:49:44,819
If resistance is broken, it becomes support. Does it need to come back down to test support?

1320
01:49:44,819 --> 01:49:50,199
So it comes to test, gets pushed back to its own base. Or do the soldiers after advancing return to get their supplies?

1321
01:49:50,199 --> 01:49:54,199
It's come back to test support now. Let's say from resistance it becomes support.

1322
01:49:56,220 --> 01:49:59,479
Yeah. It's pulled back around here. Far away.

1323
01:50:06,000 --> 01:50:13,939
But looking at it, there's not much strength left with these two tails. This can be a swing. I'll mark it like this.

1324
01:50:23,159 --> 01:50:29,000
It's not there yet, but after pulling back just this much and then surging up this high, it's definitely gone higher.

1325
01:50:29,560 --> 01:50:36,060
Another trick for reading is when price rises like this, it's relatively stable and can go far for longer.

1326
01:50:36,980 --> 01:50:44,239
But price that rises like this—this one's steep too. The steepness just suddenly shoots up like this.

1327
01:50:45,579 --> 01:50:58,979
When it drops, it'll drop with force too. Like when we drive a car slowly climbing a hill using low gear, going up steadily.

1328
01:50:58,979 --> 01:51:02,420
Almost at the top, then suddenly it's a steep incline and we floor the accelerator. Boom, shoots up.

1329
01:51:04,880 --> 01:51:08,479
Until the engine's maxed out. Then as soon as you release the accelerator just a bit.

1330
01:51:08,479 --> 01:51:10,720
The car rolls back. Because it's so steep.

1331
01:51:10,720 --> 01:51:16,159
Instead of going gradually step by step, it would go further and longer.

1332
01:51:16,159 --> 01:51:18,520
But if it rises like this, be careful.

1333
01:51:19,000 --> 01:51:20,300
When it's like this. Rising like this.

1334
01:51:20,300 --> 01:51:22,520
So be warned, then it drops with force like this.

1335
01:51:22,520 --> 01:51:24,119
Dropping to here. To...

1336
01:51:24,119 --> 01:51:25,960
Right before where it rose up sharply.

1337
01:51:26,619 --> 01:51:28,539
So at this point we need to be careful.

1338
01:51:28,539 --> 01:51:30,359
It's a support level. Be careful.

1339
01:51:31,340 --> 01:51:31,699
Right.

1340
01:51:32,079 --> 01:51:32,659
Now.

1341
01:51:32,659 --> 01:51:35,359
With our tips and techniques.

1342
01:51:36,760 --> 01:51:37,800
Others would say here.

1343
01:51:38,420 --> 01:51:39,220
Is support.

1344
01:51:41,600 --> 01:51:42,319
Support level.

1345
01:51:42,920 --> 01:51:44,960
When it bounces. Let me remove this one.

1346
01:51:44,960 --> 01:51:45,960
Or keep it for now.

1347
01:51:46,800 --> 01:51:49,220
Let's see if it'll be useful in the future.

1348
01:51:52,039 --> 01:51:54,340
We can keep adjusting these according to the current situation.

1349
01:51:56,840 --> 01:51:58,199
Like suppose here it breaks through.

1350
01:51:59,060 --> 01:52:01,979
Don't have to remove it, because we need to project the size from this line.

1351
01:52:01,979 --> 01:52:03,899
Because here I've got a new swing.

1352
01:52:04,319 --> 01:52:09,420
Taking its new high. This high. Project it forward. Let's see what happens next.

1353
01:52:09,420 --> 01:52:15,659
Now we still see it's holding the tail of this one.

1354
01:52:16,480 --> 01:52:19,500
But it's rising to make a swing. It can't just go up alone.

1355
01:52:19,500 --> 01:52:23,079
It has to pull back to create a Higher Low as a Swing Low too.

1356
01:52:25,920 --> 01:52:28,619
Around where, I don't know. We'll wait.

1357
01:52:29,319 --> 01:52:35,119
Because looking here, it's rising but starting to struggle. See? Starting to battle, trying to rise then hitting these two tails.

1358
01:52:35,119 --> 01:52:42,420
Here. Here. It's dropping now. Push it down. So we need to watch carefully because this is a weakening zone.

1359
01:52:43,720 --> 01:52:47,979
Remember the wave concept we studied? About wave sizes.

1360
01:52:47,979 --> 01:52:53,420
Pairing them up. This one goes down. This one goes up. This one's very long.

1361
01:52:53,420 --> 01:52:58,399
This one goes up, short. Goes down, then up again. But only rises this much.

1362
01:52:58,399 --> 01:53:02,159
Even shorter than before. Look, look, look, look. When rising...

1363
01:53:02,159 --> 01:53:05,640
The upward momentum's fading. The bullish conviction is weakening.

1364
01:53:06,079 --> 01:53:07,640
If we look at the momentum of the candlesticks.

1365
01:53:07,640 --> 01:53:10,659
This candle's big. This one starts... Here there are only small candles lined up.

1366
01:53:11,640 --> 01:53:14,680
And at this resistance level here there's a battle shown by tails.

1367
01:53:14,680 --> 01:53:16,859
This is looking at candlesticks.

1368
01:53:19,200 --> 01:53:22,979
Looking at the CD-DAL or our structure.

1369
01:53:22,979 --> 01:53:26,260
It rises up, of course it needs some lows. But the chart can't keep rising forever.

1370
01:53:26,260 --> 01:53:30,319
It has to consolidate. If it's going to continue, it needs to gather strength too.

1371
01:53:31,020 --> 01:53:35,899
Or if we think from the perspective of this side, the red army here, they're defending already.

1372
01:53:37,180 --> 01:53:40,920
Their army's being defeated. The major candle's already broken. An army this big is already dead.

1373
01:53:41,260 --> 01:53:43,920
They have to send in new troops to take back territory, to reclaim their land.

1374
01:53:44,539 --> 01:53:50,500
So according to our trick, where should the green side's level be?

1375
01:53:50,680 --> 01:53:55,180
Here. It rests right here. The base isn't here. It's at the tip of this tail.

1376
01:53:55,640 --> 01:53:58,159
Ah, let's keep watching to see what happens next.

1377
01:54:00,300 --> 01:54:03,340
This level, I think if it rises it can, but there are two possibilities.

1378
01:54:03,340 --> 01:54:05,479
But if it were me, I wouldn't trade yet.

1379
01:54:06,159 --> 01:54:09,319
I'd wait and watch the situation here. This scene's important right now.

1380
01:54:09,800 --> 01:54:12,340
Since it's losing momentum, it might pull back.

1381
01:54:12,640 --> 01:54:16,420
If we look at it as a pattern, it could be a Double Top.

1382
01:54:16,420 --> 01:54:17,600
Two of them here.

1383
01:54:17,600 --> 01:54:23,119
See? Is it dropping with force? It's dropping now.

1384
01:54:24,079 --> 01:54:26,819
From barely dropping bit by bit, now this candle drops.

1385
01:54:26,819 --> 01:54:28,659
Boom. Completely wiped out the soldiers here.

1386
01:54:28,920 --> 01:54:34,079
The upper side, the red side, they're starting to send reinforcements. They're coming down to take back territory.

1387
01:54:34,079 --> 01:54:44,460
Let's see if they'll break this first fort. This one. It's broken. They'll want this candle.

1388
01:54:45,140 --> 01:54:54,640
This candle's gone. Broken. Remove it. Only this left. Coming down here.

1389
01:54:55,320 --> 01:54:56,460
There's this line too. Forgot about it.

1390
01:54:57,100 --> 01:54:57,720
This swing.

1391
01:54:58,760 --> 01:55:01,659
See? It's touching the swing here.

1392
01:55:03,239 --> 01:55:05,100
Watch the symptoms. Watch closely.

1393
01:55:06,279 --> 01:55:08,779
But looking at the symptoms, will it bounce?

1394
01:55:09,539 --> 01:55:13,020
Coming into support with this much force, will this fort hold?

1395
01:55:14,280 --> 01:55:15,520
Eh, just the top of this fort.

1396
01:55:16,500 --> 01:55:19,020
It might advance all the way to this base here. This candle's evenly matched.

1397
01:55:20,700 --> 01:55:23,340
See? Broken through. Broken through, remove it.

1398
01:55:25,779 --> 01:55:27,899
Tested twice. Remove it, not important.

1399
01:55:29,200 --> 01:55:32,819
Coming to here now. Here, here. The key scene's here. The original trendline's here.

1400
01:55:33,579 --> 01:55:35,960
And the major candle's right here. Will it reach?

1401
01:55:36,900 --> 01:55:43,039
It reaches perfectly. See? But does it hold? No it doesn't. See?

1402
01:55:43,380 --> 01:55:45,239
Fights back up. This is a critical point like this.

1403
01:55:46,800 --> 01:55:50,159
We need to watch if the next candle confirms this counterattack.

1404
01:55:52,699 --> 01:55:56,220
Still green. There's still momentum going out.

1405
01:55:57,900 --> 01:55:59,500
I'm not removing this line yet.

1406
01:55:59,960 --> 01:56:02,800
It's bounced and showing signs. Let's keep this scene.

1407
01:56:03,480 --> 01:56:05,699
This scene's still useful, let's keep it.

1408
01:56:06,659 --> 01:56:09,260
Watch the strength. A major candle's resting here too.

1409
01:56:11,640 --> 01:56:13,159
Hitting the major candle. Leaving the major candle behind.

1410
01:56:13,460 --> 01:56:17,640
See? The major candle's resting here. It's acting as resistance perfectly.

1411
01:56:17,640 --> 01:56:25,359
Like this, let's keep it as a key point. If the green candles want to go up again, they have to break through here.

1412
01:56:26,480 --> 01:56:30,880
And if we look at our structure, is it still Higher High or Higher Low?

1413
01:56:32,619 --> 01:56:35,819
Well? This Low's here. This Low hasn't gone lower than this Low yet. See?

1414
01:56:36,260 --> 01:56:38,100
Still rising. High's still rising too. So

1415
01:56:38,760 --> 01:56:41,500
We can expect it to make a higher High than this.

1416
01:56:42,000 --> 01:56:46,560
We trade following the story. Following the plot. Following the series. Following the plot line like this.

1417
01:56:47,020 --> 01:56:50,760
It's favoring the hero side, the green bulls side, so we follow along.

1418
01:56:51,260 --> 01:56:55,380
Even though we see red dropping this much. Whoa, dropping this much. Wait, dropping here now.

1419
01:56:56,720 --> 01:57:11,479
It could happen. It could drop. But since the story structure is like this.

1420
01:57:11,479 --> 01:57:17,520
That is, after fighting back up, let's keep watching. Ah, dropping. But when it drops to touch here.

1421
01:57:17,520 --> 01:57:20,899
There's no strength at all. See? Here fighting back. This candle, they haven't... The major candle.

1422
01:57:20,899 --> 01:57:24,319
Here hasn't died yet. Still alive. Still there.

1423
01:57:28,180 --> 01:57:34,520
Ah, see? Trying to push back up. But pushing like this, well, it's not

1424
01:57:34,520 --> 01:57:36,659
That pretty yet. Still doesn't look very strong.

1425
01:57:38,319 --> 01:57:41,539
The level's rising step by step, step by step. But see how it keeps rising steadily?

1426
01:57:41,539 --> 01:57:43,880
And it keeps hugging the trendline all along. I haven't removed it yet.

1427
01:57:44,099 --> 01:57:47,039
That I drew from the very beginning. Okay, here it might break through and that's true.

1428
01:57:48,019 --> 01:57:50,899
But it's a sloppy break, and it gets pulled back. Pulled back. Pulled back. Pulled back.

1429
01:57:50,899 --> 01:57:57,579
Until this candle. Here. Explodes. So basically, it's still an important level. Huh. Stitched.

1430
01:57:57,579 --> 01:58:00,279
This border. Still useful. Still has soldiers. Let's say.

1431
01:58:03,539 --> 01:58:08,020
Ah, we're starting to see green's strength coming now. See

1432
01:58:08,020 --> 01:58:20,880
It? Starting to be large candles. From before, here they were small, small.

1433
01:58:21,960 --> 01:58:24,720
This one's going to fight back the major candle here. Will it reach?

1434
01:58:26,180 --> 01:58:29,859
They're trying to battle. We'll keep watching until we see something clear.

1435
01:58:29,859 --> 01:58:36,340
But according to the story structure, it already says to hold the tail. Hold the hero's tail.

1436
01:58:37,000 --> 01:58:43,659
So instead of guessing red will come down here, I'd guess we'll get a green candle going above here.

1437
01:58:44,960 --> 01:58:48,880
Because according to the plan, this novel's come this far already.

1438
01:58:50,180 --> 01:58:54,880
It'll get a high that's higher than this. According to the structure, it says so. It's an uptrend structure.

1439
01:58:54,880 --> 01:59:03,020
Here it comes. Trying to go up and eat it. But that candle's no ordinary one either.

1440
01:59:03,020 --> 01:59:05,220
It fights back up. Boom.

1441
01:59:08,060 --> 01:59:13,680
Momentum closes going up with force. But if the next candle breaks through, we're okay.

1442
01:59:13,680 --> 01:59:19,439
Ultimately it's still hugging the scene line. But this border still has soldiers that can fight.

1443
01:59:19,439 --> 01:59:23,960
It pushes back up. The next candle can still, still, still survive.

1444
01:59:23,960 --> 01:59:27,960
It can survive, hasn't died yet. It's guessing...

1445
01:59:27,960 --> 01:59:31,920
See? Boom, momentum changes instantly.

1446
01:59:32,360 --> 01:59:37,520
From small ones, like soldiers on this side, then rising Low by Low, never lower than this trendline. See?

1447
01:59:37,520 --> 01:59:40,840
For green, for the hero side. They're holding the tail.

1448
01:59:41,280 --> 01:59:44,859
They've been supporting all along. There's a force of soldiers backing continuously.

1449
01:59:45,020 --> 01:59:51,980
Never retreating lower than before, just gradually being pushed back into their own territory.

1450
01:59:51,979 --> 01:59:54,840
They send large candles to attack. Send the candles to attack.

1451
01:59:55,260 --> 01:59:57,359
But haven't reached the bedroom yet. Let's keep watching.

1452
01:59:58,280 --> 02:00:00,859
See? Can still fight. Haven't closed yet.

1453
02:00:01,199 --> 02:00:02,399
Shot up then came down.

1454
02:00:04,180 --> 02:00:07,859
And the next candle. Green's really trying hard to kill it.

1455
02:00:07,859 --> 02:00:10,100
This side won't give up. Here they're battling at full strength too.

1456
02:00:10,800 --> 02:00:14,039
This is a strong momentum candle. Pushing this hard.

1457
02:00:17,920 --> 02:00:23,079
Huh, will it drop? Let's see again. Alright, the next candle, the next candle doesn't drop.

1458
02:00:23,400 --> 02:00:28,399
It turns out to be a candle like this. Like every time it could fight before. The first two times it could fight.

1459
02:00:28,399 --> 02:00:32,520
The third time, rises to here, then only pushes back this much.

1460
02:00:33,079 --> 02:00:37,520
And closed above here. It's dead. All done. Remove it.

1461
02:00:38,420 --> 02:00:41,600
The major candle here is gone. The next zone's left.

1462
02:00:41,860 --> 02:00:46,960
That we have to watch next. See? The story continues. Like this.

1463
02:00:46,960 --> 02:00:49,979
When the major candle's dead, what's left is just the next level to push through. Like this.

1464
02:00:50,940 --> 02:01:02,500
Coming here, this probably reached a top already.

1465
02:01:02,500 --> 02:01:07,680
Going up to the zone, bouncing, then dropping with this much force. Shows that, like this, they're strong too.

1466
02:01:07,680 --> 02:01:13,239
The fort they're at around here is strong. So here coming up, after accumulating strength. Then retreating and coming up.

1467
02:01:13,239 --> 02:01:17,539
And here starting to lose strength. Need to watch the next candle.

1468
02:01:17,539 --> 02:01:21,420
If it's a green break through fine. But if it starts going to small candles starting to weaken.

1469
02:01:21,420 --> 02:01:27,020
There's a chance it'll consolidate first. Why do we call it consolidate? Why don't I view it as dropping completely?

1470
02:01:27,020 --> 02:01:29,979
Because as I said, we look at the story structure.

1471
02:01:29,979 --> 02:01:34,579
The script's supporting this side. It's waiting for higher High.

1472
02:01:35,079 --> 02:01:39,319
Waiting for a High higher than this one. Higher than this means, it has to be above this line, so it has to pass through anyway.

1473
02:01:39,319 --> 02:01:43,460
Yeah. But it has to consolidate down first. To gather strength. To get supplies and food.

1474
02:01:43,860 --> 02:01:48,920
To add energy for the soldiers to keep pushing forward. Let's see if I'm right. Oh.

1475
02:01:48,960 --> 02:01:51,520
See? And it pulls back. But will it pull back just this much?

1476
02:01:51,520 --> 02:01:52,819
I don't know. We'll keep watching.

1477
02:01:56,340 --> 02:01:57,939
Keeps coming down. Like this, see?

1478
02:02:04,079 --> 02:02:06,640
There's another trick to watch here for a moment.

1479
02:02:06,640 --> 02:02:09,539
See here? It's like a reversal candlestick. See?

1480
02:02:09,739 --> 02:02:11,980
It goes up then reverses at resistance.

1481
02:02:11,979 --> 02:02:16,600
Here's the trendline. But it doesn't drop. It pushes through. So when price retraces back like this.

1482
02:02:18,480 --> 02:02:21,939
It'll come back to find here. The one it was supposed to drop from.

1483
02:02:24,140 --> 02:02:29,180
Don't know the reason. But notice it's like this. This is an extra trick for you.

1484
02:02:29,980 --> 02:02:38,920
See? When I draw it, it hits here. Hits here. Hits here. Here it is. So this level's okay, keep it.

1485
02:02:44,820 --> 02:02:59,119
Bounces. Remove this. Will it come kill this one or what? Remove it and let's wait here instead.

1486
02:02:59,440 --> 02:03:03,359
See here, the key scene's here. Will it reach the key scene? Will it reach the key scene?

1487
02:03:05,260 --> 02:03:08,260
Trying. Oscillating here. Yeah. Swinging.

1488
02:03:09,800 --> 02:03:14,520
Swing, swing together. Battling here. There's like, to bring it here.

1489
02:03:15,380 --> 02:03:20,180
But can't make it. Now breaks up. If it's this case, I think

1490
02:03:21,800 --> 02:03:27,720
Red probably can't fight anymore. Next one should survive. See that it's rising.

1491
02:03:29,920 --> 02:03:35,359
Yeah. Not coming down again. Coming down, down, but small drops. This one's eaten going up.

1492
02:03:37,920 --> 02:03:40,979
Whoa, so long. Don't need to mention.

1493
02:03:43,000 --> 02:03:43,979
Higher High for sure.

1494
02:03:47,460 --> 02:03:48,060
This one.

1495
02:03:50,159 --> 02:03:53,220
Finished printing. See? Broke through this line up to make a Higher High.

1496
02:03:53,860 --> 02:03:55,659
Oh, forgot to mark.

1497
02:03:56,659 --> 02:03:58,560
Pulled back just this much, so Higher Low too.

1498
02:03:59,180 --> 02:04:05,340
See how the script, the script comes like this. You trade following the script.

1499
02:04:07,720 --> 02:04:08,920
At first I thought this was big already.

1500
02:04:09,140 --> 02:04:10,899
This one's big. Big candle. Big candle.

1501
02:04:11,640 --> 02:04:13,119
This candle's bigger.

1502
02:04:15,640 --> 02:04:17,319
So it can continue.

1503
02:04:19,300 --> 02:04:22,359
Do you believe it? Huh, looking from this angle it's low so it can continue.

1504
02:04:23,060 --> 02:04:26,159
Breaks through. Still continuing for real.

1505
02:04:27,860 --> 02:04:30,060
Okay, see that? Here, here.

1506
02:04:30,060 --> 02:04:31,880
At key scenes there'll be signs.

1507
02:04:32,320 --> 02:04:35,039
Because when we're at a key scene, there are still signs at resistance.

1508
02:04:36,100 --> 02:04:36,880
Oh, where'd it go?

1509
02:04:47,640 --> 02:04:48,680
Let me remove this one first.

1510
02:04:51,840 --> 02:04:53,000
Ah, it's right here.

1511
02:04:53,319 --> 02:04:56,520
Okay.

1512
02:04:56,880 --> 02:04:57,079
Here.

1513
02:04:59,539 --> 02:05:00,239
Is it like this?

1514
02:05:03,100 --> 02:05:04,380
Projected it here already.

1515
02:05:05,140 --> 02:05:06,039
Still far.

1516
02:05:14,720 --> 02:05:16,079
Has to go higher than this.

1517
02:05:19,079 --> 02:05:20,260
Ah, okay, here.

1518
02:05:21,460 --> 02:05:22,659
There. And there are signs.

1519
02:05:22,659 --> 02:05:23,640
Because it's hitting resistance.

1520
02:05:24,780 --> 02:05:25,699
Broken through already.

1521
02:05:26,520 --> 02:05:27,520
We can say this army's taken it.

1522
02:05:27,520 --> 02:05:29,239
So all the forts around here.

1523
02:05:29,680 --> 02:05:30,720
All the borders around here.

1524
02:05:30,900 --> 02:05:32,060
Green has reclaimed.

1525
02:05:32,060 --> 02:05:34,180
From resistance it'll become support.

1526
02:05:34,760 --> 02:05:36,939
Because this area's been claimed as theirs already.

1527
02:05:37,180 --> 02:05:38,020
Will it come back to test?

1528
02:05:38,020 --> 02:05:38,899
Just keeps going.

1529
02:05:41,119 --> 02:05:42,579
Shows this stick's very strong.

1530
02:05:43,220 --> 02:05:44,539
Has momentum to continue.

1531
02:05:46,360 --> 02:05:47,500
But here if we look.

1532
02:05:47,500 --> 02:05:50,420
If we look, wait. Keeps going. Hmm, I'm starting to watch.

1533
02:05:53,220 --> 02:05:53,539
Well.

1534
02:05:54,360 --> 02:05:55,720
If... who's holding.

1535
02:05:55,720 --> 02:05:59,979
If you're holding a Buy order, you might TP and just sit and watch the situation.

1536
02:06:01,000 --> 02:06:01,439
Why?

1537
02:06:02,039 --> 02:06:04,520
Here! It rose straight up like this.

1538
02:06:04,520 --> 02:06:05,720
And then struggled, struggled, struggled.

1539
02:06:05,720 --> 02:06:08,300
See how it's losing momentum in pushing up already? It's

1540
02:06:10,480 --> 02:06:16,960
Battling intensely around here. The force is equal. Just watch, just watch.

1541
02:06:17,840 --> 02:06:19,939
But the tails keep getting shorter and shorter. Shorter.

1542
02:06:23,800 --> 02:06:26,140
Come all the way here, the highest peak. Then goes up even more.

1543
02:06:30,480 --> 02:06:35,739
Goes up again. Ah, ah, notice this. Notice carefully.

1544
02:06:37,260 --> 02:06:42,119
That when it rises, it's lifting, breaking the trendline again.

1545
02:06:44,180 --> 02:06:52,659
Reading it this way is a swing point, but if it breaks the swing, it breaks this line. If it breaks this line, it'll come to the next line which is this one.

1546
02:07:00,860 --> 02:07:01,899
Running smoothly on top.

1547
02:07:04,520 --> 02:07:11,779
Had it before, holding green's tail, right? This one.

1548
02:07:19,880 --> 02:07:30,560
Holding green's tail. Momentum's starting to weaken, can't push higher.

1549
02:07:30,560 --> 02:07:34,220
Seems like there's not much strength. Even though it can make a new High.

1550
02:07:35,720 --> 02:07:39,340
Low's still rising. Chasing up.

1551
02:07:40,460 --> 02:07:43,039
Chasing up like this. We follow the situation continuously.

1552
02:07:43,820 --> 02:07:47,899
Keep watching. Can still go. If it goes well, follow it.

1553
02:07:50,020 --> 02:07:50,640
Follow it along.

1554
02:07:53,539 --> 02:07:56,079
Yeah, that's it. When we see this, that's it.

1555
02:07:57,680 --> 02:08:00,100
Low, low, low. Which Low? This Low.

1556
02:08:00,340 --> 02:08:00,539
This Low.

1557
02:08:06,159 --> 02:08:21,479
Hasn't reached here yet. They're going to kill this army. The major candle's lying here. They're trying already. Will it survive? Hard to survive. With a candle this big. This is already big.

1558
02:08:22,360 --> 02:08:28,720
This one's even bigger, breaks open. This big shows that here the director changed the script suddenly. Remember?

1559
02:08:29,060 --> 02:08:32,640
Our structure number 4, where is it?

1560
02:08:37,619 --> 02:08:42,380
The plot structure. Here. The director's making a sharp turn.

1561
02:08:42,380 --> 02:08:46,539
An unexpected event. See? Exactly the same. Exactly the same.

1562
02:08:46,900 --> 02:08:51,920
Here it bounces, boom boom. But here it drops calmly. A candle this big.

1563
02:08:53,220 --> 02:08:56,119
The momentum has to continue at least, at least has to continue.

1564
02:08:56,119 --> 02:09:00,180
I think, because there's just a bit left before it can kill it. Surging this much.

1565
02:09:00,579 --> 02:09:04,699
I think it'll let it survive? No way. Really dropping.

1566
02:09:05,760 --> 02:09:09,939
This line I'll remove completely. Not important anymore. See? Then turns into, it returns that

1567
02:09:10,260 --> 02:09:15,140
It returns to use this line instead. We draw it new. Coming to test this point. Here. Going.

1568
02:09:15,140 --> 02:09:24,359
Going. It's dead. Here's dead. Remove it. Ah, this one's out too. Just this much is enough.

1569
02:09:27,060 --> 02:09:32,979
All done. Now will there be signs? Coming to a key scene.

1570
02:09:34,880 --> 02:09:40,079
Should be support. Ah, see? Coming in here, there's a bounce, bounce, bounce.

1571
02:09:40,079 --> 02:09:44,899
Now, now if we don't exit here. We look here.

1572
02:09:44,899 --> 02:09:48,119
This still hasn't gone lower. If we look at the bigger swing.

1573
02:09:48,960 --> 02:09:51,439
We can still view it like this. Remove all of this.

1574
02:10:04,240 --> 02:10:08,060
So we view it as this swing. Then it shoots up like this. And drops like this.

1575
02:10:09,340 --> 02:10:14,000
If the director's still holding this side's tail for real, it has to make another HIGH.

1576
02:10:15,420 --> 02:10:20,760
But my thinking might change a bit. Not change, let's call it being cautious.

1577
02:10:20,760 --> 02:10:24,159
Because hitting this candle here with this much momentum.

1578
02:10:24,159 --> 02:10:28,039
To make a HIGH up and beat the major candle here.

1579
02:10:29,640 --> 02:10:32,439
If it rises with green, lots of green, here it's hard.

1580
02:10:34,280 --> 02:10:38,460
If it's going to beat this, really it has to beat it by going against the flow completely. Remember? Going against.

1581
02:10:46,900 --> 02:10:50,560
And another candle rising at least over half.

1582
02:10:53,060 --> 02:10:56,619
To come beat here, and can be small candles.

1583
02:10:57,640 --> 02:10:58,439
Let's say.

1584
02:10:59,779 --> 02:11:03,460
But if it drops with a candle this big and the candle doesn't oppose.

1585
02:11:04,820 --> 02:11:06,140
It's small.

1586
02:11:07,199 --> 02:11:09,000
And struggles around

1587
02:11:11,800 --> 02:11:12,579
Around here.

1588
02:11:12,579 --> 02:11:19,800
Like this. It's hard to beat. An army this big and you haven't even reached halfway through the large army. You'll have a very hard time reaching the major candle.

1589
02:11:22,500 --> 02:11:30,180
So it's a caution point. If going around here because it's hitting the support level.

1590
02:11:30,180 --> 02:11:39,720
Have to be cautious when entering orders. If there's a chance the order's in profit already, move stop loss to break-even.

1591
02:11:39,720 --> 02:11:46,760
Losing strength. Let's keep watching. See? Rising against it but no strength. Will it continue? Let's see. Seems like no.

1592
02:11:48,340 --> 02:11:52,579
Here, really no strength to go up. It's hard.

1593
02:11:55,520 --> 02:11:58,340
If we want it to be easy, hmm, not easy, if we want it to be possible.

1594
02:11:58,340 --> 02:12:02,020
It would have to be like this period. See how here red came down with force too?

1595
02:12:02,739 --> 02:12:06,920
Killed the major candle here. Killed it. Oh no wait, not yet, oh haven't killed this one yet.

1596
02:12:06,920 --> 02:12:11,479
So it could send it back up. Oh this one, the major candle hasn't died yet.

1597
02:12:11,479 --> 02:12:14,359
See? Coming down then suddenly going up, so there's a chance to send it up.

1598
02:12:15,400 --> 02:12:16,279
But, but.

1599
02:12:17,060 --> 02:12:19,859
This candle here's already dead. This one's been killed.

1600
02:12:20,119 --> 02:12:24,460
So the candle that'll send soldiers to support here to go up.

1601
02:12:24,460 --> 02:12:25,260
There's none.

1602
02:12:25,260 --> 02:12:27,520
There's none left.

1603
02:12:27,520 --> 02:12:31,239
There are only a few soldiers along the border, along this trendline here. Just a bit scattered.

1604
02:12:31,940 --> 02:12:33,059
Can they fight back up?

1605
02:12:33,060 --> 02:12:40,520
Like here, when it accessed coming down, it can't cross over here anymore. Here it keeps lifting, talking about going up.

1606
02:12:41,480 --> 02:12:48,079
But here it has to lift. If it's going to send up, it lift, but it's not lifting, so it's going to tilt down somehow.

1607
02:12:49,380 --> 02:12:50,340
Don't need to watch yet.

1608
02:12:51,680 --> 02:12:56,319
Yeah, there's a fight going up. But here, see? It's a scene.

1609
02:12:59,199 --> 02:13:06,079
And here is whose territory? This candle's. If here's green. Green really green.

1610
02:13:06,079 --> 02:13:10,960
Is this called a last gasp green? Like there's not much strength left in green to fight back.

1611
02:13:10,960 --> 02:13:14,560
But it seems unwilling. Because here it's starting to have tails, tails. Not giving up and shooting up.

1612
02:13:14,920 --> 02:13:18,899
If the next candle's still green going up and continuous, there's a chance they want to fight here.

1613
02:13:19,780 --> 02:13:21,260
Want to come kill the major candle here.

1614
02:13:23,720 --> 02:13:28,020
But if it's still a small candle again. Shows this is the last gasp. It might reverse down.

1615
02:13:29,440 --> 02:13:33,640
See? It's not continuous. We view it as a candle, it's not continuous.

1616
02:13:34,000 --> 02:13:36,819
That if you combine these 2 candlesticks, you'll get a large pin bar.

1617
02:13:36,819 --> 02:13:41,340
This is resistance, right?

1618
02:13:41,579 --> 02:13:42,600
Goes up comes down. Goes up comes down.

1619
02:13:42,600 --> 02:13:44,920
And if it's a pin bar at resistance, is there a chance to drop?

1620
02:13:44,920 --> 02:13:46,659
Yes. There's a chance to break this level.

1621
02:13:49,159 --> 02:13:50,319
Many candles can be combined.

1622
02:13:51,020 --> 02:13:52,680
Many candles combined still give you a pin bar.

1623
02:13:52,680 --> 02:13:53,939
This group of candles.

1624
02:13:55,539 --> 02:13:56,600
Pin bar at resistance.

1625
02:13:56,600 --> 02:14:04,140
Yeah, see? Will it survive? It drops. As soon as it drops like this.

1626
02:14:05,819 --> 02:14:10,739
I'm viewing the director as changing the script completely. The top line I'll remove. Not using anymore for sure.

1627
02:14:13,159 --> 02:14:18,979
Because, because I'll mark here new. Ah, where'd they all go?

1628
02:14:21,020 --> 02:14:21,699
Borrow this first.

1629
02:14:26,600 --> 02:14:30,039
Here I make it starting, High.

1630
02:14:30,039 --> 02:14:33,560
What's this?

1631
02:14:37,340 --> 02:14:37,659
It's

1632
02:14:37,659 --> 02:14:44,520
Goes up just this much then drops. So here will become

1633
02:14:49,100 --> 02:14:49,439
High.

1634
02:14:53,119 --> 02:14:56,579
And it's lower already. It's lower than this, so it has to

1635
02:14:56,579 --> 02:15:01,380
Has to be Lower Low for sure. Definitely has a Lower Low somewhere, don't know where.

1636
02:15:01,699 --> 02:15:02,640
Keep it waiting for now.

1637
02:15:09,659 --> 02:15:16,680
See? Momentum came. Dead already. But this one's still there. This major candle's still lying here. Lying here.

1638
02:15:17,300 --> 02:15:21,520
Will it take it? Will it kill it? With the momentum sent. Here sent. See?

1639
02:15:21,520 --> 02:15:25,420
Normally, at the momentum sent, it should send and continue already.

1640
02:15:25,420 --> 02:15:27,720
And soldiers will come back to rest. Top up supplies casually.

1641
02:15:27,720 --> 02:15:30,460
When they retreat back, whoosh comes down.

1642
02:15:30,460 --> 02:15:33,439
Send army number 2 down around the same time.

1643
02:15:34,020 --> 02:15:37,460
The momentum sent here has broken through this level already. This line.

1644
02:15:38,619 --> 02:15:39,479
And look here.

1645
02:15:40,079 --> 02:15:41,920
Only tiny soldiers.

1646
02:15:41,920 --> 02:15:44,399
Will definitely reach here. Here I think will definitely reach.

1647
02:15:45,100 --> 02:15:47,340
Will definitely reach the major candle's room here. It's so far.

1648
02:15:48,420 --> 02:15:54,239
Reaches perfectly. See? Kill it? Not sure.

1649
02:15:56,400 --> 02:16:02,380
Might be evenly matched. Evenly matched. But like this, killed completely. Remove it.

1650
02:16:03,440 --> 02:16:07,359
Dead. This way's dead. Dead, so where to go?

1651
02:16:09,840 --> 02:16:13,979
There's a chance to come to next support. Next scene. The scene after.

1652
02:16:14,300 --> 02:16:19,340
Like here. Dead. And there. This one. Right? Reached. But. Now if we look, it's

1653
02:16:19,340 --> 02:16:24,260
Starting to be down candles. For it to come down to here with strong force again, let's keep watching.

1654
02:16:25,300 --> 02:16:32,680
Okay, here. Very short already. And very small. Small already. I think it has to

1655
02:16:32,680 --> 02:16:36,600
Curve back up to test this level a bit.

1656
02:16:36,600 --> 02:16:45,700
After making it, we can say it's the start of a downtrend. High then Low gone.

1657
02:16:45,700 --> 02:16:51,260
Down from the structure, Lower Low. Then the director changed the script structure. And we follow the director.

1658
02:16:51,720 --> 02:16:57,459
Just this much. Not hard. I'd say quite changing. Changing too violently.

1659
02:16:57,459 --> 02:17:15,680
This period turned too sharply. So it has to make a new swing.

1660
02:17:15,680 --> 02:17:22,059
Because with the structure and form, there's no arm to have the strength to rise.

1661
02:17:22,059 --> 02:17:26,360
Like the last soldier trying to die more than anything.

1662
02:17:27,239 --> 02:17:31,120
Here. Don't see.

1663
02:17:32,339 --> 02:17:33,340
This candle's here.

1664
02:17:35,819 --> 02:17:37,479
Sent to support.

1665
02:17:37,479 --> 02:17:42,700
But can it fight back? This candle's still lying here.

1666
02:17:44,340 --> 02:17:49,180
And it'll fight back. But it won't make it. Even just beating this candle's already hard.

1667
02:17:49,559 --> 02:17:54,299
These ones keep getting smaller. There's a chance to drop more.

1668
02:17:57,679 --> 02:18:01,379
It's consolidated. As soon as it consolidates, I can put it here. Right? Because it's consolidated.

1669
02:18:01,379 --> 02:18:05,959
It's a swing already. Endorfer high. Once it makes endorfer high, it has to have lower, right?

1670
02:18:06,939 --> 02:18:08,459
Has to have lower than this for sure.

1671
02:18:11,500 --> 02:18:16,020
Is this it? The major candle's here. Coming down there are signs, bounces up.

1672
02:18:16,460 --> 02:18:20,280
At the major candle level, whether it survives or not, there has to be a battle.

1673
02:18:20,280 --> 02:18:27,739
There's price oscillation. Oscillating. Broke from the trendline.

1674
02:18:28,780 --> 02:18:31,719
Remove the trendline for now. Let's watch the situation first.

1675
02:18:32,540 --> 02:18:34,760
As long as it hasn't made a high higher than this High.

1676
02:18:35,880 --> 02:18:44,639
Can beat, come back. Here. It still has a signal of downtrend structure. Ah.

1677
02:18:44,639 --> 02:18:50,520
Goes up, hits, tests resistance. Then drops. Ah, right. See?

1678
02:18:50,520 --> 02:18:54,180
Lower than this Low. Here goes lower, lower, lower than this Low.

1679
02:18:54,180 --> 02:18:56,739
And still gets lower, lower, lower than this Low. If it's a swing point.

1680
02:18:56,739 --> 02:19:03,659
It walks along. And will it drop more? I view it will drop more. Why? See?

1681
02:19:03,659 --> 02:19:07,639
This is very small already. Last gasp. Emerged from water.

1682
02:19:07,639 --> 02:19:13,559
Will sink or not sink. The major candle's here. See anything?

1683
02:19:13,559 --> 02:19:17,020
Is the major candle dead yet? Closed already. Here the price closed lower than this one.

1684
02:19:17,319 --> 02:19:20,920
This army's dead. If dead, what's left below?

1685
02:19:21,239 --> 02:19:24,100
Around here. And if we look, have to go back far.

1686
02:19:24,679 --> 02:19:25,479
Only this left.

1687
02:19:27,259 --> 02:19:27,680
Just a bit.

1688
02:19:29,340 --> 02:19:31,639
Don't think it'll be a very strong army.

1689
02:19:31,639 --> 02:19:34,100
Think they should be able to break through down.

1690
02:19:35,859 --> 02:19:37,559
From the momentum coming down.

1691
02:19:38,759 --> 02:19:39,340
See?

1692
02:19:40,219 --> 02:19:40,780
Coming down.

1693
02:19:41,879 --> 02:19:44,399
Continuous downward momentum.

1694
02:19:44,399 --> 02:19:46,059
These 3 consecutive candles are considered strong.

1695
02:19:46,059 --> 02:19:47,860
The momentum's already sent.

1696
02:19:48,539 --> 02:20:01,000
If it's a car, it shifted to high gear, then slowly into peak gear, then into low gear going down, the car flows fast, sliding or skiing down.

1697
02:20:01,979 --> 02:20:05,559
Will definitely break through here. No large army here to defend. To send soldiers to fight at all.

1698
02:20:07,939 --> 02:20:08,760
Lower high too.

1699
02:20:10,139 --> 02:20:11,760
If it's going to be Lower Low, it has to go Lower Low.

1700
02:20:11,760 --> 02:20:14,079
See? Dropping more.

1701
02:20:15,679 --> 02:20:23,719
The oscillation's long too. Because look how it consolidated down. This one. And then mark it new.

1702
02:20:26,979 --> 02:20:30,899
Mark it new means keep adjusting it continuously.

1703
02:20:38,519 --> 02:20:39,819
And adjust to change into resistance.

1704
02:20:44,960 --> 02:20:46,139
Whoa, can't take it.

1705
02:20:49,540 --> 02:20:53,979
Ah, bounce. See? See this scene?

1706
02:20:54,180 --> 02:20:57,120
Here's a resistance level. Because this one broke down already. See?

1707
02:20:57,120 --> 02:21:01,420
Momentum. And when it tries to go up, it runs out of strength. It hits resistance.

1708
02:21:02,360 --> 02:21:05,760
Green hits red's resistance. The major candle's lying here.

1709
02:21:06,040 --> 02:21:09,620
Oh, the bedroom's here. This is the trendline I marked up new to update it.

1710
02:21:09,960 --> 02:21:12,860
See? It reacts around here. This period.

1711
02:21:17,260 --> 02:21:23,239
Keep watching continuously. Yeah, trendline breaks. They remove it. Not hard at all.

1712
02:21:23,239 --> 02:21:29,000
Just think new, make new. Just that. This one remove it too. That's changing. Can see already.

1713
02:21:29,000 --> 02:21:35,440
The plot changes. But the plot's still a downtrend continuously. As long as it hasn't made a High higher than this High.

1714
02:21:36,319 --> 02:21:38,200
It'll still have to be a Lower High.

1715
02:21:44,180 --> 02:21:53,280
In summary, you should understand. The method of reading charts like a movie. Don't know what to call it.

1716
02:21:55,119 --> 02:22:01,760
The foreigner who taught me when I took a recent course, he taught reading candlesticks like this. This detailed. Watch strength, watch momentum.

1717
02:22:02,219 --> 02:22:12,239
Not the whole chart. Not looking for, like, reversal candles. Where are they? Are there reversal candles? What's this? Morning Star?

1718
02:22:13,079 --> 02:22:16,559
See a Morning Star? Then why doesn't it rise?

1719
02:22:22,500 --> 02:22:41,239
Nothing.

1720
02:22:42,260 --> 02:22:47,139
And the tricks that, this other thing he didn't mention, he only talks about support levels.

1721
02:22:47,139 --> 02:22:51,459
This thing, you can mark according to peaks. Like this. Or according to groups of candlesticks that

1722
02:22:51,459 --> 02:23:00,159
Cluster together. Groups that cluster, whichever way like this, you can mark as a level.

1723
02:23:00,159 --> 02:23:04,239
A bit, mark as a level. Here, wherever clusters, you mark, mark, mark.

1724
02:23:04,239 --> 02:23:07,700
Mark like this. You can mark support and resistance this way. This is talking technically.

1725
02:23:09,620 --> 02:23:13,180
Just that our trick adds more. With these candles here.

1726
02:23:15,059 --> 02:23:18,959
These major candles. The major candle has a bedroom, has a base always at the very back.

1727
02:23:18,959 --> 02:23:24,819
The other side tries. If the other side wants to invade the opposite side's territory.

1728
02:23:24,819 --> 02:23:28,420
Have to kill the major candle. If don't kill the major candle, they keep sending soldiers to support.

1729
02:23:28,420 --> 02:23:31,860
Or if you're skilled yourself, you yourself can fight enemies back anytime.

1730
02:23:31,860 --> 02:23:35,540
Get it? The major candle's like this, can keep fighting like this.

1731
02:23:35,540 --> 02:23:37,440
And keep sending new armies, sending new armies like this.

1732
02:23:38,440 --> 02:23:39,959
So this point I don't see any at all.

1733
02:23:39,959 --> 02:23:44,540
Here, how will I mark resistance here?

1734
02:23:44,540 --> 02:23:48,579
There's a strong order here. See? Like past ones like this. Here.

1735
02:23:50,399 --> 02:23:54,659
Look. Here, here. Why's it here? And price is just here and goes.

1736
02:23:55,559 --> 02:23:58,159
Well, it's here. The candle's here. The bedroom's right here. The candle.

1737
02:23:58,159 --> 02:24:02,260
Why, for real, the price will bounce. Has to come here. Hmm.

1738
02:24:03,739 --> 02:24:05,600
Let's try measuring Fibo. Will we get it?

1739
02:24:08,239 --> 02:24:09,180
Around like this.

1740
02:24:11,940 --> 02:24:15,180
One more thing to give you as a bonus. That is

1741
02:24:15,180 --> 02:24:22,319
Or you measure leg by leg. When measuring upward legs, you measure here, put 100 at the bottom.

1742
02:24:22,319 --> 02:24:26,159
Measuring retracement rate. Put 100 at the bottom here.

1743
02:24:26,959 --> 02:24:30,120
Then drag up to the swing point at the top here. And it retraces down.

1744
02:24:31,719 --> 02:24:36,120
And the retracement points are 30, 60, 61.8 around here.

1745
02:24:36,120 --> 02:24:38,100
See? It retracted to 61.8.

1746
02:24:39,620 --> 02:24:43,040
Then it goes up. It's a scientific point. Um, psychological point.

1747
02:24:44,479 --> 02:24:46,760
When we measure retracement, we measure following the trend first. Like this.

1748
02:24:47,040 --> 02:24:50,520
Here. Take from the upward swing. This one will drop, right? Then how far will it drop?

1749
02:24:51,159 --> 02:24:54,520
I drag it. See? 61.8. It comes around here.

1750
02:24:55,220 --> 02:24:59,700
Reverses. If you look like a cat at the major candle. Look like a cat, use Fibo, you'll see like this.

1751
02:25:01,880 --> 02:25:06,260
But really, you look at major candles. These ones. There'll always be someone who wants to kill them.

1752
02:25:06,260 --> 02:25:08,819
If you want to reclaim territory. You have to kill the major candle.

1753
02:25:09,920 --> 02:25:14,120
You have to hurt these armies. If you can't hurt them, how will you take the other side's territory?

1754
02:25:14,319 --> 02:25:19,059
Get it? Just this. You trade following this. Following the structure.

1755
02:25:19,620 --> 02:25:27,100
This is the plot. Trade following the plot. Whose script is supporting whom?

1756
02:25:27,399 --> 02:25:31,239
We go with that. Hide along with them.

1757
02:25:31,719 --> 02:25:35,299
And look for key scenes, key scenes. Look at the characters.

1758
02:25:37,260 --> 02:25:40,159
These are the important ones. The main characters. The leaders.

1759
02:25:41,219 --> 02:25:44,020
When the leader dies, the whole group dies. Get it?

1760
02:25:44,659 --> 02:25:52,040
These armies are just for reading the symptoms of candlesticks, of momentum, that's all.

1761
02:25:52,620 --> 02:26:00,619
So I hope this course, for those who are already skilled, you've gained some additional techniques to add to yourself.

1762
02:26:00,680 --> 02:26:03,620
As for beginners, I think after this course.

1763
02:26:04,739 --> 02:26:08,840
You'll have ideas, have methods, and you'll be able to survive in this market.

1764
02:26:10,139 --> 02:26:13,420
Much better than before. The percentage is definitely much higher than before.

1765
02:26:14,019 --> 02:26:17,260
So now, we'd like to thank you for following along all the way.

1766
02:26:17,719 --> 02:26:20,100
Thank you very much. Goodbye.
