00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:07,599
Hello everyone, today we'll be talking about Money Management, or MM for short.

2
00:00:08,199 --> 00:00:29,600
For MM, I'm focusing on just two things: Position Sizing, or the lot size you'll use when placing orders.

3
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:41,600
Why do we need MM? Besides having good entry points, MM is crucial because sometimes even with a bad entry, if your MM is good, your account can still grow.

4
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:51,600
Now let's see if you can use just MM alone without any Technical Analysis or Fundamental factors. Using only MM, some accounts can actually grow.

5
00:00:53,200 --> 00:01:01,700
Like this example here, this is about calculating lot size.

6
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:07,299
We'll adjust it based on the width or cap of the Stop Loss.

7
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:16,200
We'll assume, it depends on us, how much we're willing to lose.

8
00:01:16,599 --> 00:01:21,599
Let's say we use 5% in this case.

9
00:01:21,599 --> 00:01:25,700
Stop Loss or SL, regardless of the distance, we'll only risk 5%.

10
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:28,000
Whether you set it tight or wide.

11
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
But if price moves against us and hits our SL line.

12
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
We'll only lose 5%, the money lost is just 5% of the account.

13
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,500
Of the account value at that time only.

14
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:40,500
For example, with $1,000 capital, if we're wrong, we'll lose $50.

15
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:46,000
Now when trading, there's one important factor in the formula.

16
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
As you can see in this formula, when calculating.

17
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
It's different for each currency pair.

18
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Some pairs are the same though. What is it?

19
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:02,000
When we enter a lot size and price moves, when it moves there'll be numbers on the side.

20
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
See? The middle number.

21
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,500
Shows how many points it moved. We call them points.

22
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:12,000
Some people call them pips, but pips aren't the same because 1 pip equals 10 points.

23
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
10 points.

24
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Pip value means when price moves 1 pip, based on the lot size we use, how much do we gain or lose?

25
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,000
And how do you find the pip value? Easy, just use websites that calculate it for you.

26
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Brokers have tools that let us calculate.

27
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,500
Like Tickmill, just go to Tools.

28
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:32,000
Here, Forex Calculator.

29
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
It'll let you calculate various things like currency conversion.

30
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Or calculate Margin, and this is the Pip Calculator.

31
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:44,000
For example, the currency pair, set the account as US Dollar.

32
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
The pair we're trading, let's say EU, a popular pair.

33
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Lot size.

34
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Let's say if you enter 0.1 lots, every time it moves 1 pip.

35
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
You gain or lose $1 per pip.

36
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
But if you enter 1 lot, 1 pip equals $10.

37
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Or simply put, that 1 pip is 10 points.

38
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,500
Just multiply by the lot size directly.

39
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:07,000
If we trade 1 lot.

40
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
If we enter an order here.

41
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
And it moves to here.

42
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
With 1 lot, we'll make $3,916.

43
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Just follow the middle number.

44
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Multiply by 1 directly.

45
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Because in pips it's 391 pips.

46
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
391 pips.

47
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
What about gold?

48
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,500
Click here, it's the same as EU.

49
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:29,000
Gold just now.

50
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,500
Earlier it was over 300 pips, right?

51
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:34,000
Oh, gold will be slightly less.

52
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,500
If 1 lot.

53
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:36,500
1 lot.

54
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:39,000
Earlier it would've been over 300 pips.

55
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
0.1.

56
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,500
It'll reduce to just this.

57
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:43,000
Just multiply directly.

58
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Alright.

59
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Let's try again.

60
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Let's say UJ.

61
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
With UJ you'll start to see.

62
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:55,000
That it changes, 1 pip equals $8.9, not $10. It becomes fractional, see? UJ.

63
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:01,000
If you check other brokers, they calculate the same. Like XM, where is it? Here, investor calculator.

64
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Where's UJ? There it is. 1 lot, click it. There, $8.89 profit per pip. See? Same, $8.89.

65
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,000
What about FBS? FBS, it'll be in the section.

66
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Here.

67
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
FBS will have several pairs. Let's try many pairs.

68
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Like this one is EU.

69
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
UJ.

70
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Let's try an unusual pair. This one.

71
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
One of mine.

72
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,000
A state one. Trading a state pair, click. There.

73
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
See? The pip. What's this? A-C-A, CAD.

74
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Australia and Canada, $0.77. EU is normal.

75
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:39,000
$1 per point, because it's not pips, it's points.

76
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
UJ $0.89 per point. If this one, see it's in pips.

77
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Pips means 10. UJ in pips.

78
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:49,000
If you want to convert this value to be equal, it has to be in points. If converting points to pips, multiply by 10.

79
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,000
This becomes 10, this becomes 8.9, roughly like that.

80
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Just a comparison. Back to our topic. Once we know, let's say I'm using UJ.

81
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:02,000
We want to find the lot size. We have $1,000 capital, multiply by what we're willing to lose, which is 5% risk, 5%.

82
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Divide by SL. Let's say we drag SL to 100 points, divide by pip value, we'll get the lot we should enter, which is 0.56.

83
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Does that make sense?

84
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Other pairs are calculated the same way.

85
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
But there's an easier way to calculate.

86
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:17,000
You don't have to sit and calculate. I'll show you a tool. This is explaining the theory.

87
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:22,000
To help you understand how to use MM. The second important factor is this.

88
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Risk-Reward. Simply put, it's the ratio of SL to TP, which is Stop Loss to Take Profit.

89
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:33,000
In the picture it shows a 3:1 ratio. 3, it might be written wrong here.

90
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:38,000
This could be 1:3 if we translate it this way. 1 is here, 3 is here. Risk 1.

91
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Reward 3. So risk is 1 part, see? But when you get the reward it's 3 parts.

92
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:49,000
So 200 points. When TP hits, it's 3 times, 2 times 3, which is 600. So TP must be set at 600 points.

93
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:54,000
When you lose, it's 200. When you win, it's 600. So what's the benefit of RR? It comes into play with the system.

94
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:59,000
If the system you're using has about 40% accuracy, let's say.

95
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Any system with 40%, less than half. Even a coin toss is 50-50, this is even lower.

96
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,000
But we protect ourselves with RR in our trading always.

97
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:13,000
So if accuracy is just 40%, trade 100 times, win 40. We'll lose up to 60 trades.

98
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
When we win, we only win 40 orders.

99
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Doesn't look like it'll work.

100
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,000
But we set RR at 1:2, meaning when we lose 1, we gain 2.

101
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Just 2, not going for more like 1:4 or 1:7. Just 1:2, half and half.

102
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Think of it in points. So if SL is 100 points, TP must be more, or 2 times, right?

103
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,000
1:2, 2:1, sometimes looking at it I don't know which comes first.

104
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Let's just say we understand that the reward must always be more than the risk.

105
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:46,000
So SL 100 points, TP 200 points. So if we lose 60 times, hitting TP.

106
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,000
We have to take a beating. Because we set TP far from the entry point.

107
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,000
SL distance from entry is 100 points.

108
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,000
So when it hits SL, that means it moved against us 100 points every time.

109
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,000
And it went wrong 60 times. So we'll lose a total of 6,000 points.

110
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:07,000
On the flip side, if we hit TP 40 times. Hit TP all 40 trades.

111
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:12,000
That's 8,000 points. Because it's 40 times 200 points, which equals 8,000.

112
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,000
When we subtract the losses, we're actually in profit.

113
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Even though we only won 40 times, but our RR is 2:1.

114
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,000
1:2, the reward is twice.

115
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Always 2 times the risk. In those 40 trades.

116
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Even though we lost 60, we're still up 2,000 points.

117
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Even with only 40% accuracy. So if your system.

118
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Has accuracy better than 40%, try calculating if you'll be profitable.

119
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:43,000
That's the second thing, Risk-Reward. The first was determining lot size.

120
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
These two factors are crucial.

121
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
If you combine these two like this.

122
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Blend them together, your account can grow without even being that accurate.

123
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Because if we use accuracy, let's make the system a bit better than earlier.

124
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
60% accuracy is enough.

125
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Same as before, 2:1.

126
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Risk 5% of the account.

127
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:12,000
If starting capital is $1,000, test it for one month. Excluding weekends, that's four weeks, 5 times 4 is 20, so about 20 days.

128
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:17,000
With a 60% win rate. The system is 60% accurate. So if you test 100 times.

129
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:22,000
We'll be right 60 trades and wrong 40 trades. Wrong means hitting SL.

130
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:27,000
But we won't trade 100 times. We're only trading once per day.

131
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Wake up in the morning until evening, enter an order whenever. I don't know when. When you see a good opportunity, you think you're right.

132
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:37,000
According to your system, you enter. Because the system is 60% accurate. So in 20 days.

133
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:42,000
We'll be right 12 days when entering orders. Lose 8 times. Hit SL 8 times.

134
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Remember, when we lose, we lose 5% of the account, of the account value at that time.

135
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Not always calculated from 1,000.

136
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Of the account value at that moment, what's remaining.

137
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
So when we gain, it's 2:1.

138
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Risk 5, reward goes up 5, so reward must be how much?

139
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:05,000
It must be 10%. 5 times 2 equals 10, right?

140
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Look at the example. Day 1, entered an order, we have starting capital of $1,000. When we gain 10%.

141
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Account becomes $1,100. Day 2, gain again. System is still 60% accurate, still in the winning streak.

142
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:20,000
It'll be 10% of 1,100, not 10% of 1,000, right?

143
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
It compounds, increasing more and more like this.

144
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:28,000
But day 3, the system starts to be wrong because there's a 40% error rate.

145
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:33,000
We multiply this number by 0.95, which means it loses 5%.

146
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Risk comes out.

147
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:39,000
So from 1,200 it reduces to just over 1,100.

148
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Day 4, we lose again, calculated from here, 1,149.

149
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Not calculated from 1,000 continuously.

150
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,000
It reduces again, down to 1,092.

151
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Close to original capital now. Lost twice. Gained twice, lost twice.

152
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Then gain again. Day 5, back to gaining. It increases again.

153
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,000
It alternates between gains and losses randomly. Continuing to calculate.

154
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:07,000
After 1 month, or after 20 trades. Starting from an account with just $1,000.

155
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
It becomes $2,000. See? It can grow.

156
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Even with wins and losses, but we control the RR.

157
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
See? Control the RR and the risk percentage we set.

158
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,000
If your RR is more accurate than this.

159
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Your system is 60% accurate but your RR is higher. This system returns higher than 2:1.

160
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:30,000
And risk is 5% or the task is less than this, try calculating to see.

161
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:35,000
What the final account value will be. Now if.

162
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Wait, let me make the line bigger.

163
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Thicker.

164
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Line size.

165
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Okay.

166
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,000
What is it? It's what we'll use to enter orders.

167
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
The blue line.

168
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:51,000
This will be the line we use to enter orders. Can't see it, right?

169
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Because it'll be right at the price. Here, blue.

170
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
The entry line. The green line.

171
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Let me change it.

172
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Um.

173
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Let's make it.

174
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Um.

175
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
If it's a loss, it should be red. Hit SL.

176
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,000
TP, let's keep it yellow like before.

177
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Here. Right here. Okay.

178
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Like this. The line. Let's set it here.

179
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
We open up the program.

180
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Click here to make it Pending.

181
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Then we can move the blue line.

182
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,000
This is the order line where we'll enter the order.

183
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Let's say...

184
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Which area is good? This area.

185
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Let's use this area. This is, let's say we're going to buy. We'll buy.

186
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Let's say the chart is moving. We haven't seen this range yet.

187
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:37,000
The chart moves down, down, down, then let's say it comes up to about here.

188
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Then call an order in this range. Let's say enter here.

189
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,000
And it makes a low, a high, a high or low.

190
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Higher high, higher low. We expect higher high.

191
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,000
If it's still an uptrend, it should be higher high.

192
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,000
And the low shouldn't be lower than this low. It must be higher.

193
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:59,000
The new low must not be lower than this low. It must make a high first.

194
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:03,000
So we buy here. If we're not wrong.

195
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:08,000
We can move the red line. If we move it below this line, it means this line is a buy.

196
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:14,000
If we move the red line above this line, the program will automatically figure out that this line is a sell.

197
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Because it's higher. The Stop Loss line, when we move it.

198
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Up or down between the order line.

199
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Buy here. Let's say buy. Buy means going up.

200
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Up.

201
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
One day to the top. Let's say we set it here.

202
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
See? It read the order.

203
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Now we set the program.

204
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Here, risk. Let's say we set the risk at.

205
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:43,000
When we lose, let's say 3% each time. 3%. 3% of the account. Let's say the account value is about this much, 3% of this amount.

206
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:47,000
The money we'll lose is over $400. Now let's set another one. Set it in the Indicator.

207
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Let's edit this one. Look here. TP×SL. This is 1:1. Whatever RR you want to set your system to.

208
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Let's say we set it at 2:1, 1:2. Whatever it is, basically TP is always 2 times SL. Edit it to the number you want.

209
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Mine will be 2. Let's make it 2.

210
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Then click here. See? The take profit will jump automatically.

211
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:11,000
So when we buy here, we have SL here. TP will be shown up front at this spot.

212
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Let's say we entered and the chart doesn't reach it because we set TP, right?

213
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Doesn't reach, doesn't hit SL either.

214
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Returns, returns, returns. Then TP. We made money according to the value.

215
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Now let me show. Enter here. Let's say no, enter here. Change to 3%.

216
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Let's watch closely.

217
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:33,000
3%, $404. Watch closely. Earlier we entered here.

218
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:37,000
SL here. Change it again. Change it again. Look closely. Buy here.

219
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Buy here. Same lot is here. Pull it here. This is the difference.

220
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:46,000
2,679 points. The distance between the order line and SL is quite a lot because this is on the Day timeframe.

221
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Click here. TP will be here. This is 2 times the SL. Entered buy here.

222
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Price moves, moves, moves. Because we set the principle at this low. Did it hit TP? Did it hit TP completely? Hit TP, made profit. And if it lost, it would still be 3% of the account, which is $404. Let's try again.

223
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Let's say enter here. Buy here, enter another trade. Buy here. SL is quite far. Oh, it's far.

224
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Scared of losing a lot. Actually, we won't lose a lot.

225
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Because we calculated it already, it's 3%. No matter what, we only lose this much. Set it at the bottom. If it hits, we accept it. Something like that.

226
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Then TP. TP here.

227
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Buy here going up. Hit TP first. See?

228
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Made profit first. But let's say, let's say TP we set higher than this.

229
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Let's say. Let's say we set it around here.

230
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,000
So more than 1:2. Price goes up, up, up, up.

231
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:33,000
While, while. One thing everyone needs to watch when entering an order is.

232
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
The lot size. What lot will you enter?

233
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
It's right here.

234
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Position Size. See?

235
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:44,000
If you enter an order here, Stop Loss is here, you enter 0.22 lots.

236
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:49,000
TP 1:2, at TP 2 times. It hits here, you'll make.

237
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:55,000
How much? If it hits, if it hits. Wait. High 0.22 in.

238
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:00,000
This range, you'll get the reward here. About $800.

239
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:05,000
About $800. If it hits SL, $400.

240
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:10,000
See? About 2 times. But this $400 is 3% of the account, of the account value itself.

241
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Now the opposite, enter sell here, same thing.

242
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:19,000
But SL, you're scared it might hit but if.

243
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:23,000
It'll really go up, it shouldn't be lower than this low. You choose to drag SL down lower than this.

244
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:27,000
See the distance changed? Click, where should TP be?

245
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Should be here. But the order you entered is at the exact same point.

246
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Just changed SL to be closer. You enter at this lot.

247
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,000
0.1. Earlier it was 0.22.

248
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:42,000
This became 0.1. But when TP hits.

249
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Goes down, doesn't hit SL, goes up and hits TP. You get the same amount.

250
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:51,000
$809. But if this hits, you still lose the same, which is $404. It calculates everything.

251
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,000
This one. See? Let's enter a different point. Let's try sell.

252
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Let's say sell here.

253
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Here. Where? Here.

254
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Several. SL is here, the red line. If you sell, you must put the red line above the order line.

255
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Let's say set it here. TP. Click here, it'll jump. TP is here.

256
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:12,000
The SL distance is how much? Don't know. Can't see. But if it hits, it's this, over $400.

257
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:17,000
No matter what, we lose over $400. Entered already. Then price moves back and forth, playing sell.

258
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Comes to about the original order line. Oh well, might as well close manually. Might think that. Goes up.

259
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:26,000
But it's okay. Let's wait it out. If it hits, it hits. Because we set it to only lose 3% of the account.

260
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Let's see. Price starts to swing, loses momentum. Price goes down, hits TP. Made $800.

261
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Let's try again. Let's say very confident. Won't set it this far. Entered order here, right?

262
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Set it at the bottom. Super confident. If it hits, it hits.

263
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Then where will TP be? TP is here. Short trade. Enter order, plan to win immediately.

264
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Lot increases to 0.4 immediately. Boom. Hit, made $800.

265
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:52,000
It hit first. Let's say it didn't hit. Let's say it came here, then went up and hit here. Still lose $404.

266
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Very scared. Really scared. Use this high.

267
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Over 6,000 points. Enter order here. Where's TP?

268
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,000
TP is very far. There. See the yellow?

269
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Here. Where did we enter earlier? Here.

270
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Just wait. Move with it. Hit SL first. Lose $400.

271
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Because the lot entered from here is 0.05.

272
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:19,000
At first entered 0.4, now only entering 0.05.

273
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:24,000
So when it reverses back and hits, we only lose 3% risk percentage.

274
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,000
If in dollar terms, it's $400, same as before.

275
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:32,000
But let's say it doesn't hit. Let's say it doesn't hit, moves, then goes down. Let's say it touches here. Boom.

276
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:36,000
You make $809, same every time.

277
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,000
So this is lot calculation.

278
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Which it calculates based on the SL distance you set.

279
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,000
This became 0.1. If you set it this close.

280
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Enter 0.2 lots.

281
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Where's TP?

282
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,000
TP is here. Enter here.

283
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Move to SL then TP first. Made money first.

284
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
See?

285
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Keep doing this. If you're confident, you can go change the value. Change.

286
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:10,000
The value to make TP be how many times. Let's say make it 3 times.

287
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Think it's very accurate. Great system. Can go far. Then come change.

288
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Or. Click.

289
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Further than before. Earlier was 1:2. This is 3 times. Made more money, $1,200.

290
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:26,000
But when you lose, lose the same, over $400.

291
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,000
All of this is calculated from current account value.

292
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:33,000
It integrates with the principles we learned earlier.

293
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Now, what else is there?

294
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Oh, this is because I chose pending, so I can move the entry point anywhere. But when you trade for real, it has to be at the current price. Just click here to make it instant.

295
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Alright.

296
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:49,000
The line will be at the current price line where it's moving. Ready to enter the order, just click enter order.

297
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Then set SL. But we can drag this SL, we can always drag it manually.

298
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Drag it. Let's say we'll sell. Let's say it'll go down. Sell, put it.

299
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Let's say put it at this candle. More than a thousand points.

300
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Same risk, 3% as set. Where should TP be? Click. Boom. It's 3 times. Here, it's here. So it has to move down here to hit TP.

301
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Made $1,200 if it hits TP with 0.26 lots. But if scared it'll swing around here, scared it'll touch.

302
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Goes up a bit more. So for safety, where will TP go?

303
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:24,000
It's here. But if it hits SL, still lose 3%, $400 same. If it hits TP.

304
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Still make $1,200 same. But lot changed to 0.12 instead when entering.

305
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,000
At this point. Hope you understand.

306
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:36,000
About MM. I'll upload the tool for you.

307
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:41,000
I should upload it. If you can't install it, you can click.

308
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Here. Open this. Opens up.

309
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:49,000
You just drag the file you downloaded and drop it in here. Then close the window.

310
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Go close the program. Open again. Or you don't have to close the program. Refresh.

311
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Then. The name of it is. I'll tell you the name.

312
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:02,000
The name is this one. Let's say we closed it. Pull it in. Then set the values.

313
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Like I said earlier. Nothing difficult. Okay.

314
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Okay. Hope it's understandable and somewhat useful regarding MM to use.

315
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Your account can grow. Use good MM.

316
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Even if your system isn't very accurate, it can still grow. See?

317
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Okay. Thank you very much. Goodbye.
