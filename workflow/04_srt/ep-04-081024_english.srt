1
00:00:01,299 --> 00:00:11,619
Hello everyone, we've reached Part 3, the component that works together with the first two parts we've already learned.

2
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:17,019
That is, candlesticks and support and resistance, and this is the final component.

3
00:00:17,019 --> 00:00:23,100
Before we move to the final part that we'll learn next, which brings everything together.

4
00:00:23,859 --> 00:00:27,539
To create a clear picture when you look at charts, read charts, and read them more clearly.

5
00:00:27,779 --> 00:00:29,660
It's called Dow Theory.

6
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:35,340
So this guy Dow established it.

7
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:37,359
The market has its own cycles.

8
00:00:37,359 --> 00:00:44,039
There's greed and fear, all these things exist in the up and down cycles of the chart.

9
00:00:44,379 --> 00:00:46,439
That's it, according to Dow's first principle.

10
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:49,060
The market has already absorbed everything.

11
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:50,899
Second principle.

12
00:00:50,899 --> 00:00:53,320
Dow says the market moves in trends.

13
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:54,100
Always.

14
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:56,060
Is it always true?

15
00:00:56,060 --> 00:00:57,039
There will be some periods.

16
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:00,079
Where it consolidates.

17
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:03,000
So we'll have these.

18
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:04,980
Uptrend.

19
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,200
Moving up.

20
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:08,420
Price continues moving up.

21
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:10,340
Continuously.

22
00:01:12,119 --> 00:01:13,000
Downtrend.

23
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,180
Downward trend.

24
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:20,159
This is uptrend, downtrend, price will keep going up or down continuously.

25
00:01:21,860 --> 00:01:24,000
These have their limitations.

26
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:27,180
Uptrend - Higher High and Higher Low.

27
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:30,180
Downtrend is lower high.

28
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:32,040
Followed by lower low.

29
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:34,060
I'll expand on this later.

30
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:37,560
And this one is called no trend, or it's moving sideways.

31
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:41,440
It's not going up and it's not going down, moving sideways, we call it sideways.

32
00:01:53,560 --> 00:02:08,620
Like this, it's called downtrend, uptrend, which consists of swing high, swing low, swing high, swing low.

33
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:14,060
At this point, you should all understand swing high and swing low now, it's just price going up and down, up and down like this.

34
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:20,379
When it goes up and comes down, when it turns downward, we call it swing high. When it turns upward, that's swing low.

35
00:02:21,159 --> 00:02:25,020
Whether it's an uptrend or downtrend, where it turns upward is always a swing low.

36
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,719
Where it turns downward is always a swing high.

37
00:02:27,719 --> 00:02:33,400
When we learned about support and resistance, these are the points where we draw support and resistance levels.

38
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,699
At the swing high and swing low points, same thing.

39
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:43,180
This picture is the same, but right now we're not learning about support and resistance.

40
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,539
We're learning about trends.

41
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:50,780
The definition of a trend.

42
00:02:52,340 --> 00:03:01,180
The purple part here, for price to be in a trend, it must have these components.

43
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:06,379
You need to have these 4 points.

44
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:15,219
First, if it's an uptrend, you need to have the initial high, the original high.

45
00:03:17,039 --> 00:03:30,520
Let me change this a bit, oh well, never mind. And you need to have the original low, see?

46
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:38,719
High and low, you need these two parts first. And the parts that tell us it's an uptrend are these two.

47
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:47,960
Higher high. Higher high, translating from English, if we translate to Thai, high means the height, the original high point.

48
00:03:49,439 --> 00:03:55,819
Higher high means a high point that's higher than the original, this point here is called higher high.

49
00:03:56,360 --> 00:04:00,300
Is it higher? If we draw a line, it's higher, it went up further, see?

50
00:04:00,479 --> 00:04:01,539
This is called higher high.

51
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:06,280
And another component you need to have to call it an uptrend.

52
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:09,400
That is, you need to have a higher low.

53
00:04:10,599 --> 00:04:13,580
Which is a low that's higher than the original low.

54
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:17,100
Same thing, look, drawing a line.

55
00:04:17,799 --> 00:04:20,420
This low is higher than this one, it doesn't touch here.

56
00:04:27,959 --> 00:04:33,500
Just having these two, high and low, is not enough. You need higher high and higher low.

57
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:47,839
In Thai, we say you have a new highest point and a low point that's elevated.

58
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:59,839
Low, but not as low as before, it's elevated. High, even higher than before. With one, two, three, four, these 4 components, it's called an uptrend.

59
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:11,199
Downtrend is the same, you need 4 components. You need a starting point, which is the original low.

60
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:16,720
Meaning you have the initial low and the initial high.

61
00:05:17,839 --> 00:05:22,699
And when it swings down, we get a lower low.

62
00:05:22,939 --> 00:05:24,759
Which is a low that's lower than the original low.

63
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,379
This is the original low here.

64
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:32,319
This one breaks through this line, see how it's lower?

65
00:05:32,319 --> 00:05:35,399
So it's called lower than the original low, a lower low.

66
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:40,339
And the high, of course, must be a lower high.

67
00:05:40,939 --> 00:05:43,860
A high that's lower than the original high.

68
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:46,060
The original high is here.

69
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:51,160
The new high doesn't reach it, see? Lower than the original.

70
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:54,639
This is called Dow Trends, a downtrend.

71
00:05:55,879 --> 00:06:00,420
You need these same 4 components, but if you only have one of them.

72
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:06,399
You have the original high, let's say, and you have the low.

73
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:13,899
But you don't have a higher high, you don't have this one.

74
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:18,060
It's still just a high, like this.

75
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:32,439
And you still have a high, and it's a low.

76
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:42,579
It's a low, it doesn't have those two words yet, these two.

77
00:06:42,579 --> 00:06:43,879
Higher higher, lower lower.

78
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,819
It's high high high low low.

79
00:06:48,499 --> 00:06:53,620
So it's not a trend, easy right?

80
00:06:54,019 --> 00:06:57,420
But if during this period, it stays here.

81
00:07:00,819 --> 00:07:03,680
It goes up like this, and whoosh, comes down.

82
00:07:04,259 --> 00:07:08,579
What happens? The original low.

83
00:07:08,979 --> 00:07:12,800
This one stays the same, it's still a low, see?

84
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:15,160
But here it went higher.

85
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:16,920
So what will happen here?

86
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:20,000
Here we'll get a higher high.

87
00:07:21,939 --> 00:07:23,459
This is a higher high now.

88
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:27,819
This, oh, can't see it at all.

89
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:30,319
Let me remove it.

90
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:33,680
How do I remove this?

91
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:41,560
Should be like this, let's see.

92
00:07:54,819 --> 00:07:59,720
Let's look at this again carefully.

93
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:10,680
We see this now, original high, original low, one, two, and suddenly it goes up, we encounter a new one.

94
00:08:12,619 --> 00:08:13,319
Encounter a new one.

95
00:08:14,499 --> 00:08:16,420
I can change the text, like this.

96
00:08:17,579 --> 00:08:18,040
Sure.

97
00:08:20,979 --> 00:08:22,139
Higher high.

98
00:08:22,599 --> 00:08:25,420
After it swings up, it doesn't go further, it comes down.

99
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:28,519
It retraces down, and after retracing, coincidentally.

100
00:08:29,859 --> 00:08:31,000
Coincidentally again.

101
00:08:31,659 --> 00:08:33,720
It turns back up a bit.

102
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:36,740
Just a little bit is enough, doesn't need much, and it becomes.

103
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:39,980
Higher low.

104
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:45,179
See how it came down but didn't reach this low?

105
00:08:45,179 --> 00:08:48,960
So it has to be an elevated low, right? Now the components come together.

106
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:51,220
If we have these 4, one, two, three, four.

107
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:56,899
Just these are enough, don't need more. With just these we can call it an uptrend.

108
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:01,200
It's an uptrend, meaning it broke out from.

109
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:06,720
Broke out from the sideways range and.

110
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:19,100
It's an uptrend that we're ready to trade as an uptrend now. Let's look at a chart for a bit, just a bit, like this.

111
00:09:20,919 --> 00:09:36,120
Like this, what kind of trend is this? Downtrend, clearly, because, this part is easy, clearly a downtrend, why?

112
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:45,100
Uh, why? Well, here, the original high.

113
00:09:57,179 --> 00:09:59,240
Oh, Dow Theory is here.

114
00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:22,340
Let me redo this, hard to write, let me do it like this and capture it.

115
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:26,519
How much?

116
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:29,000
High.

117
00:10:29,779 --> 00:10:34,179
High, I'll start counting from here, or you can count from here, whichever you prefer.

118
00:10:34,699 --> 00:10:42,519
High, initial high, initial high, and then low.

119
00:10:43,459 --> 00:10:47,700
And what happens here? Lower high.

120
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:53,340
High. And what about here? Lower.

121
00:10:57,220 --> 00:10:58,399
Low, a low that's lower than the original low.

122
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:02,779
Is it really lower? The high is here, the original high is here.

123
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:08,740
A high that's lower than the original high, it's clearly lower because this one doesn't touch this line, see?

124
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:13,679
What about the low? A low that's lower than the original low.

125
00:11:14,139 --> 00:11:17,419
This one here, the original low is at this line, this is lower than this line.

126
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:20,019
That reaches the swing low.

127
00:11:21,819 --> 00:11:22,620
Therefore.

128
00:11:23,199 --> 00:11:25,700
Of course this is a downtrend.

129
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:27,360
We can call it a downtrend.

130
00:11:28,679 --> 00:11:31,980
See? And it will continue in its series.

131
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:34,279
Until it changes on its own.

132
00:11:34,779 --> 00:11:35,679
Right.

133
00:11:36,279 --> 00:11:38,059
The opposite for an uptrend.

134
00:11:39,799 --> 00:11:41,899
This one is clearly a downtrend.

135
00:11:43,879 --> 00:11:45,220
It repeats itself.

136
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:46,379
Accordingly.

137
00:11:46,379 --> 00:12:06,960
Like this, ah, like this, this, this, yeah, this, yeah, still.

138
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:10,460
Yes, when it completes the components continuously, this is called.

139
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:14,460
A downtrend, quite clearly, uptrend.

140
00:12:16,379 --> 00:12:21,580
And what about uptrend? Uptrend is.

141
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:31,960
Which area should we use? This area works, easy.

142
00:12:39,539 --> 00:12:44,840
This one, we can count from here too.

143
00:12:47,339 --> 00:12:49,340
Draw it in, like this.

144
00:12:53,539 --> 00:12:57,779
As the starting point, we'll make it a low.

145
00:12:59,719 --> 00:13:01,019
Let's say counting the swing.

146
00:13:01,019 --> 00:13:01,940
Let's say counting the swing.

147
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:04,080
Count the big one, this one, or count the small ones.

148
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:05,720
Let's say we count from here.

149
00:13:05,939 --> 00:13:08,220
It's a high.

150
00:13:10,219 --> 00:13:12,399
And then it retraces down, see this here?

151
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:13,360
Price retraces down.

152
00:13:19,239 --> 00:13:20,159
It's a higher low.

153
00:13:22,419 --> 00:13:24,399
Is it a higher low? Yes.

154
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:26,399
Because the original low is here.

155
00:13:26,939 --> 00:13:28,200
But price stopped here.

156
00:13:28,679 --> 00:13:30,179
It didn't come down to touch this line.

157
00:13:30,179 --> 00:13:31,940
Meaning it's a low that's higher than before.

158
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:36,500
Of course you can see it with your eyes, I'm just citing the theory.

159
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:41,419
Therefore, this point must be a higher high.

160
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:47,080
There, and then it will.

161
00:13:47,879 --> 00:13:51,000
Just like before, continuing like this.

162
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:56,279
Better find this one, here, here.

163
00:13:56,279 --> 00:13:56,299
Here.

164
00:13:59,899 --> 00:14:00,679
Higher low.

165
00:14:02,699 --> 00:14:03,559
Elevated low.

166
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:05,440
Elevated low.

167
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:11,220
Elevated low, and this one.

168
00:14:11,459 --> 00:14:12,879
This one is about the same.

169
00:14:13,679 --> 00:14:15,960
Let's just stop here.

170
00:14:16,999 --> 00:14:19,820
Actually I think it's still elevated if you look closely at this point.

171
00:14:22,199 --> 00:14:22,860
A tiny bit.

172
00:14:25,079 --> 00:14:26,259
If you don't want to be confused, it's very close.

173
00:14:28,039 --> 00:14:33,179
But just this much, you can see it's an uptrend.

174
00:14:35,059 --> 00:14:39,559
Uptrend according to Dow's definition is like this.

175
00:14:40,339 --> 00:14:48,720
You have 2 starting points, a low and a high, and if you have higher high and higher low, it's called an uptrend.

176
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:57,279
The earlier one was a downtrend, and there's another type where it doesn't go up and doesn't go down.

177
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:07,720
We can use this one, right here.

178
00:15:20,219 --> 00:15:22,240
Make it smaller, this one.

179
00:15:31,419 --> 00:15:32,480
Just draw the lines.

180
00:15:34,339 --> 00:15:39,460
It's a range, see? Moving within a range.

181
00:15:42,799 --> 00:15:44,919
And for the starting point, it will be.

182
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:49,480
Can find it here.

183
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:55,740
Start here, this point.

184
00:15:59,080 --> 00:15:59,399
Low.

185
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:04,559
There will always be 2 points.

186
00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:06,820
We need to find the starting point first.

187
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:07,440
High.

188
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:11,100
Low, there's a low here, low.

189
00:16:14,679 --> 00:16:16,399
Low and then swing up to a high.

190
00:16:20,519 --> 00:16:22,639
This has a higher high.

191
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:27,379
Looks like it could be uptrend, has a higher high.

192
00:16:27,859 --> 00:16:33,700
But that's okay, let's count from here first.

193
00:16:39,819 --> 00:16:40,279
Ah.

194
00:16:40,279 --> 00:16:40,539
Ah.

195
00:16:40,539 --> 00:16:41,080
Ah.

196
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:41,080


197
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:41,080


198
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:41,080


199
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:42,460
Looking at it, it seems like it could be.

200
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:43,539
Actually.

201
00:16:43,539 --> 00:16:46,039
According to theory, it would be right.

202
00:16:48,519 --> 00:16:49,639
But it might not be.

203
00:16:49,639 --> 00:16:50,379
Because this.

204
00:16:50,379 --> 00:16:51,419
We're counting this swing first.

205
00:16:51,419 --> 00:16:54,039
We're counting this high as the starting point because then there must be a low here too.

206
00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:56,980
This one will be a higher low.

207
00:16:59,120 --> 00:16:59,759
Right here.

208
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:03,580
One, two, three, four, all 4.

209
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:03,940
Okay.

210
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:05,099
This is an uptrend.

211
00:17:06,139 --> 00:17:07,200
Just this part.

212
00:17:11,099 --> 00:17:18,400
They're about equal, it seems like it's not going to elevate, so exclude that, and then when it comes up here.

213
00:17:19,899 --> 00:17:22,819
It becomes a lower high.

214
00:17:25,699 --> 00:17:27,140
And then it comes down again.

215
00:17:29,859 --> 00:17:34,460
This is lower than this, it's a lower low.

216
00:17:39,879 --> 00:17:45,799
Simply put, it's no longer continuing in an upward series.

217
00:17:47,279 --> 00:17:50,920
Low, high, and then it should go up again.

218
00:17:51,259 --> 00:17:54,079
It breaks down right here, no continuation.

219
00:17:55,319 --> 00:17:57,339
Here it goes down, just looking at this, it's down.

220
00:17:58,899 --> 00:18:04,440
It goes up, but this high here is almost equal.

221
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:04,440


222
00:18:04,699 --> 00:18:09,740
It's still not clearly counted as one, okay, this one might come down to be.

223
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:15,200
There is that, but it goes back up, look, evenly matched again, down then up.

224
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:20,859
Very simply, if you look, look, just look at this period, I'll use the pen right away.

225
00:18:20,859 --> 00:18:25,539
This period, going up, see? Up, oh.

226
00:18:28,819 --> 00:18:29,720
But this period is down.

227
00:18:32,660 --> 00:18:39,500
If you just look at this, oh, this part is up again, if you look clearly, it's about.

228
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:51,200
Like support and resistance, remember? It's a zone, it's a zone, it's in.

229
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:58,519
A range, it will be rectangular, I mean, it's like, approximately like.

230
00:18:58,519 --> 00:19:04,799
A range, and price is moving inside, no matter what, it seems to be.

231
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:08,220
Bouncing inside a bit, but in the end, it's just moving.

232
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:16,019
Not going anywhere, moving sideways, if it's moving like this.

233
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:20,980
You'll see it looks like waves of equal height, like this.

234
00:19:24,979 --> 00:19:35,759
You can see it's clearly sideways. If you want to be sure, look at it with support and resistance, it looks pretty messy.

235
00:19:35,759 --> 00:19:45,460
Breaking everything, support and resistance lines, breaking through all over the place, breaking like crazy, and not really respecting support and resistance that much.

236
00:19:46,399 --> 00:19:51,920
Like this is support, if it comes down and becomes resistance, no it's not.

237
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:54,180
It breaks back and forth, this is called sideways.

238
00:19:55,799 --> 00:19:59,259
No trend, not trending, understand?

239
00:19:59,939 --> 00:20:04,220
Let's keep it simple for now, don't think too much, don't think too much, don't overcomplicate it.

240
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:15,440
This is a trend. I'm explaining this for beginners.

241
00:20:16,619 --> 00:20:20,799
Coming back to our topic, you should be able to see which is which now.

242
00:20:21,759 --> 00:20:28,839
Okay, drawing trend lines, we talked about this in the support and resistance lesson.

243
00:20:29,219 --> 00:20:35,579
This is the correct way to draw it, he shows examples, this one cuts through, this one is wrong, skip it.

244
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:44,519
Okay, now let's look at trend analysis, when it's an uptrend or downtrend, or sideways.

245
00:20:44,519 --> 00:20:53,160
What happens is the chart that forms will be a trend that looks like waves, you understand it's like waves?

246
00:20:55,539 --> 00:20:57,940
Yeah, we have waves, like waves.

247
00:20:57,940 --> 00:21:01,900
Look, let me clear the purple first.

248
00:21:09,939 --> 00:21:18,359
Like this, look, it moves like this, we call it waves.

249
00:21:20,139 --> 00:21:23,920
When we first talked, we learned specifically about individual candles.

250
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:32,339
Candlesticks, individual candles like this, but many candlesticks combined continuously.

251
00:21:32,699 --> 00:21:38,240
They form wave patterns, right? In these waves, there will be how many candlesticks?

252
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:44,619
Tons of them, countless, who knows, like this, but we won't focus on that anymore.

253
00:21:44,619 --> 00:21:47,019
At this point, we only focus on the waves.

254
00:21:50,119 --> 00:21:52,440
We're looking at the big picture.

255
00:21:55,079 --> 00:21:57,559
Now these waves are what we'll analyze.

256
00:21:58,319 --> 00:22:04,339
At first when we learned in the first part about candlesticks, we analyzed.

257
00:22:04,759 --> 00:22:06,039
We analyzed the candlesticks themselves.

258
00:22:07,359 --> 00:22:12,519
We read them candle by candle, continuously, to see what events might happen.

259
00:22:12,519 --> 00:22:26,859
Going forward into the future, whether it'll keep going up or if there's a tendency to go down by reading candle by candle. Now we'll read them as waves, the big picture, to see.

260
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:34,460
What's likely ahead, I use the word likely, what it could be like.

261
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:39,259
Let's continue.

262
00:22:42,740 --> 00:22:47,980
We need to pair them up, pair them up, when we see the overall chart like this, showing like this.

263
00:22:49,499 --> 00:22:52,299
We pair swing high with swing low.

264
00:22:54,259 --> 00:23:00,220
In sets, one after another like this, like this, going up, this is low, this is high, and running back to low.

265
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:04,279
Three points, ABC, or one, two, three, easy to count, like.

266
00:23:04,279 --> 00:23:10,440
This, you see it? This, wait, let me show you again.

267
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:11,460
One, like this.

268
00:23:16,199 --> 00:23:24,779
This, one, two, three, this is one period, when it's done, we count.

269
00:23:24,779 --> 00:23:33,339
A new set, from 3 here, it becomes 1, 2, 3 of this set, of this set.

270
00:23:34,699 --> 00:23:43,940
Count again, here it becomes 1, 2, 3 of this set, and then count a new set.

271
00:23:44,399 --> 00:23:49,160
And if there's more, keep counting continuously as 1-2-3, 1-2-3, pairing them up like this.

272
00:23:52,179 --> 00:23:58,319
You ask, for what purpose? To analyze the waves, analyze the strength of the waves.

273
00:23:58,319 --> 00:24:04,119
Whether the trend is strong or weak, ah, how it's moving.

274
00:24:04,119 --> 00:24:08,839
Which direction it will go, after we've already analyzed candlesticks, we'll look at waves as well.

275
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:14,039
It's another tool, or another piece of knowledge, if we know and combine everything.

276
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:17,720
It will help us read charts even better.

277
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:20,519
Sometimes when we read candlesticks, they might say one thing, but waves say another.

278
00:24:20,519 --> 00:24:21,500
Whoa, which one do we believe?

279
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:27,920
This, we'll get to this in the final part that we'll learn together.

280
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:34,180
This part, let's just take it step by step first, pairing like this.

281
00:24:34,180 --> 00:24:49,599
It will have its own names, like M, like this.

282
00:24:49,599 --> 00:24:51,059
Anyway, pairing them up.

283
00:24:54,319 --> 00:25:00,720
They will classify them once paired, see how they're paired? But they'll categorize a bit.

284
00:25:01,899 --> 00:25:07,599
Type A, Type A is when it goes up and then retraces.

285
00:25:07,599 --> 00:25:14,799
Goes up then retraces, see? Goes up then retraces, when they classify types, they look at the retracement.

286
00:25:14,799 --> 00:25:16,940
Not when it goes up, but when it retraces.

287
00:25:17,899 --> 00:25:21,500
Vice versa when it goes down then turns back up.

288
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:23,559
We count at the point where it turns up.

289
00:25:24,859 --> 00:25:25,339
Confused?

290
00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:27,740
Count here.

291
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:30,400
The theory counts here, the theory counts.

292
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:31,940
If it's upward movement, count when it retraces.

293
00:25:33,079 --> 00:25:34,220
But if it's downward movement.

294
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:36,940
Count when it turns back up.

295
00:25:37,539 --> 00:25:38,059
Right here.

296
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:43,900
Right here, to classify or categorize the type of wave.

297
00:25:45,539 --> 00:25:52,980
Type A, Type A is when it retraces, and counting the full length of the rise, it comes down less than 50%.

298
00:25:54,740 --> 00:26:00,240
If it's a down move, it retraces back up less than 50% of what it came down.

299
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:08,519
This is type 1, Type A, like this, goes up then down, if the level is here, it doesn't reach it, and continues.

300
00:26:10,699 --> 00:26:18,599
Type B reaches about 50%, approximately, retracing approximately.

301
00:26:18,599 --> 00:26:22,079
And the last type, this is an example, retraces about 50%.

302
00:26:22,359 --> 00:26:27,279
Type C retraces more than 50% of the initial rise that went up.

303
00:26:27,559 --> 00:26:32,619
The impulse move, the retracement comes down and bounces back more than 50%.

304
00:26:33,299 --> 00:26:34,420
Like this, like this.

305
00:26:35,980 --> 00:26:40,180
You ask why do we need to know? Because each pattern A-B-C.

306
00:26:40,180 --> 00:26:43,180
It indicates the strength of the move.

307
00:26:44,519 --> 00:26:47,359
Look, they have their rules, rules of thumb.

308
00:26:48,659 --> 00:27:06,680
Pullback wave, this is it, pullback wave is the move that goes against the original direction. Simply put, if in this case it's an uptrend, it goes up, goes up meaning it has low, higher low, higher low, higher high, higher high, higher high.

309
00:27:07,419 --> 00:27:16,440
But when it retraces before it makes a higher high in the uptrend, it's divided into these 3 types, less than 50%, at 50%, more than 50%.

310
00:27:17,159 --> 00:27:27,339
The one that reaches or doesn't reach, exceeds or doesn't, the stronger the retracement is, the weaker the uptrend becomes.

311
00:27:28,119 --> 00:27:35,700
Meaning like this, goes up like this, reaches 50%, this one doesn't reach 50%.

312
00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:42,559
But this one exceeds 50%, the wave will be weak, meaning when it continues, it won't go very far.

313
00:27:48,219 --> 00:27:55,779
If it goes far, it has a chance, like this, you can look at this wave, look at this one, went up this much, let's say 50% is here.

314
00:27:56,359 --> 00:27:58,539
It only retraced this much and continues.

315
00:27:59,099 --> 00:28:00,559
See? It continues much further.

316
00:28:02,299 --> 00:28:03,160
But look at this one.

317
00:28:03,799 --> 00:28:05,940
Went up and retraced more than 50%.

318
00:28:06,679 --> 00:28:08,680
Went and struggled like this.

319
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:12,400
If we look in terms of candlestick strength.

320
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:13,420
It seems like it's starting to.

321
00:28:14,459 --> 00:28:16,519
Soon it will start, maybe around this area.

322
00:28:16,519 --> 00:28:18,240
And it will probably curve down.

323
00:28:22,319 --> 00:28:23,720
Now let's look at quality.

324
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:28,619
The quality of the trend.

325
00:28:29,740 --> 00:28:35,859
Like this one, we'll look specifically at the moves that go in the direction of the trend.

326
00:28:36,859 --> 00:28:39,259
In the direction of the trend, which is.

327
00:28:50,019 --> 00:28:52,259
Let's say uptrend.

328
00:28:55,139 --> 00:28:59,839
Another one is downtrend, the earlier example was downtrend, right?

329
00:29:00,419 --> 00:29:02,519
Look at the moves that go in the same direction as the trend.

330
00:29:02,519 --> 00:29:05,180
This trend goes up, this trend goes down.

331
00:29:07,259 --> 00:29:07,920
We look at this one.

332
00:29:08,619 --> 00:29:08,900
Oh.

333
00:29:09,399 --> 00:29:17,619
For example, look at this one, look at this one, look at this, look at this, it's downtrend, we look at where it goes down.

334
00:29:17,619 --> 00:29:20,740
We don't look at where it goes up, we look at where it goes down, see?

335
00:29:22,779 --> 00:29:27,079
Look at the distance, measure the distance, bop, bop, the consistency, see?

336
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:34,059
About 250, it's between this, this, like this is considered a strong trend.

337
00:29:34,059 --> 00:29:42,339
It's a good trend, it's a quality trend, because it will just keep going like this, see? When it comes down.

338
00:29:42,339 --> 00:30:04,039
This trend, downtrend, it will keep going continuously, won't stop. If we buy here.

339
00:30:04,039 --> 00:30:07,500
Fifty, quite inconsistent, like the earlier one, see?

340
00:30:07,959 --> 00:30:12,819
It's about this much, plus or minus percentage is similar, but this one, this is a lot.

341
00:30:12,819 --> 00:30:17,859
This one is little, this is even less, comes back a lot again, oh little again, this is a lot.

342
00:30:19,859 --> 00:30:22,480
Looks like it's doing well, it's running then suddenly shoots up.

343
00:30:23,359 --> 00:30:32,579
Follow it in, thinking it'll go further, but this type of trend, they consider, Westerners consider.

344
00:30:33,159 --> 00:30:39,680
It's not very strong, why it shoots up like this, but if you look at the big picture.

345
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:52,460
They look at this as, this is learning about waves, not candlesticks.

346
00:30:52,659 --> 00:30:55,740
It's like, if driving uphill, gradually step on the accelerator.

347
00:30:57,439 --> 00:30:58,720
Finally step full max.

348
00:30:58,959 --> 00:31:01,839
Like the road is very steep, very steep incline too.

349
00:31:04,159 --> 00:31:06,180
Runs out of power, it flows down, drops.

350
00:31:06,439 --> 00:31:08,160
Something like that.

351
00:31:10,759 --> 00:31:11,960
Okay, let's look at an example.

352
00:31:13,119 --> 00:31:16,180
Suppose we see this pattern, what do we need to do?

353
00:31:17,559 --> 00:31:19,059
We pair them up.

354
00:31:19,579 --> 00:31:21,140
Like this, look at it as waves.

355
00:31:25,699 --> 00:31:32,960
Wave number 1, then down up, then down up, then down up, down up, but we don't care about the down.

356
00:31:33,299 --> 00:31:39,119
We want to analyze the consistency of the trend following the trend direction, use the term following the trend.

357
00:31:39,119 --> 00:31:44,599
Trend direction. Low is here, higher low, higher low, higher high, higher high.

358
00:31:44,599 --> 00:31:46,359
Therefore, this is clearly an uptrend.

359
00:31:51,140 --> 00:32:07,119
Following this, it's going up this way, up way, up way, up way, not down at all, let's do it again, this is not down way. Now let's analyze the first pair, rises to this point then drops down here, this is

360
00:32:07,119 --> 00:32:08,779
the return, return, the first pair.

361
00:32:09,379 --> 00:32:11,960
Let me explain simply. One, two, three, there are three pairs.

362
00:32:12,339 --> 00:32:13,980
Like the first pair, like this, we'll see that

363
00:32:14,220 --> 00:32:16,440
it's quite long and strong, then drops down.

364
00:32:18,159 --> 00:32:21,180
When it drops, it doesn't drop much. See? Doesn't drop much.

365
00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:24,960
Doesn't exceed, probably doesn't exceed 50% of

366
00:32:26,779 --> 00:32:29,079
the wave that surged up following the trend.

367
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:31,880
So it should be classified around

368
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:44,299
probably the type of wave we just learned, not A then B, should be around this. Now when it rises again, the second pair, pair it up again

369
00:32:45,559 --> 00:32:46,099
Ah

370
00:32:47,740 --> 00:32:56,000
You'll see that the second one that rises is actually shorter than this one.

371
00:32:56,899 --> 00:33:05,160
This means this one is strong, because the second wave is less strong than the first wave.

372
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:20,440
And when it reverses back down, if you measure the height coming down, it probably exceeds 50% of the wave that pushed up in the same direction as the trend.

373
00:33:21,039 --> 00:33:35,220
Drops down, should exceed 50%, should be yes, should be around 50% or, if it's here, suppose 50% is here, then it exceeds, should definitely exceed 50% at this point.

374
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:42,559
This shows the strength of this wave set is weaker than this wave set. This is already an important point, starting to weaken.

375
00:33:44,379 --> 00:33:49,099
Then the last one, it just keeps going, ah, like the type we learned, ah

376
00:33:49,359 --> 00:33:56,039
Just now, right, that it's not consistent. Strong, weak, strong, and look at the drop point. Drops

377
00:33:56,039 --> 00:34:02,940
a little, drops a lot. This trend is weakening, which might not be finished weakening yet.

378
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:05,920
Might drop further, or it might continue up, we don't know yet.

379
00:34:06,259 --> 00:34:08,019
Just analyzing only the waves first.

380
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:10,719
Take what we see clearly.

381
00:34:11,540 --> 00:34:12,760
We can say that

382
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:14,599
this wave at the beginning

383
00:34:14,940 --> 00:34:15,679
was strong.

384
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:17,719
Look at the first pair, first set.

385
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:19,219
Surges like this.

386
00:34:19,559 --> 00:34:21,880
Here, suppose this might be Sideways, I don't know.

387
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:23,940
But when it starts becoming a Trend, it surges really strong.

388
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:26,380
Then pulls back just a little bit.

389
00:34:26,519 --> 00:34:29,579
Has a chance to continue, of course. See? If we follow, this is Type

390
00:34:30,420 --> 00:34:33,199
wave type, Type A, rises then pulls back a little, not reaching 50

391
00:34:33,460 --> 00:34:36,480
or around 50, it can continue far. If we count from

392
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:39,159
this first set, it can continue this much.

393
00:34:39,159 --> 00:34:41,699
It rises like this, still going far following

394
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:43,239
the energy of

395
00:34:43,239 --> 00:34:51,179
like this set, it pulls back a lot, it pulls back a lot, it does rise further, that's true, but it looks weak.

396
00:34:53,740 --> 00:35:01,420
Tired already, might not go as far as this one that sent, sent the whole set forward to this one, can you imagine?

397
00:35:03,660 --> 00:35:07,019
Looking at the second one, it's starting to weaken compared to the first.

398
00:35:07,780 --> 00:35:16,420
Therefore, the third one rises as strong as the first. If you look at the length, they're similar.

399
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:26,860
Therefore, the overall picture, if we analyze it, the health is still considered good.

400
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:30,679
Just looking at these three rises, because this part isn't finished yet.

401
00:35:30,679 --> 00:35:35,500
If we see the end part, we'll know whether the health is very good or not so good.

402
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:39,639
If we see it pulls back only this much, and here might be support too.

403
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:43,659
It might turn back up and continue. This shows that if it really pulls back only this much

404
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:56,559
it would be a Type A wave, which is A below 50, A, C, A, still considered a Grade A type wave, can still continue, has a chance to continue.

405
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:59,420
And we analyze like this.

406
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:08,300
Like this example, this is very strong, shoots up, this is definitely A, not reaching 50%, but the second wave is shorter than this one, much shorter.

407
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:12,119
And drops down exceeding 50, clearly, see?

408
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:17,300
Therefore, we'll analyze that it's not very pretty.

409
00:36:19,180 --> 00:36:23,400
Rising like this, health is not very good.

410
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:28,699
It might rise at most to around the previous High at this point.

411
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:32,219
Then it could reverse down. The health is already not good.

412
00:36:32,219 --> 00:36:35,699
It rises well here, but here it's not so good.

413
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:42,440
This is analyzing as waves, not looking at candlesticks yet, it's like a line chart.

414
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:48,500
Dare to buy? Just buy. If you look at it as an uptrend, it's still lifting the Low.

415
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:51,239
This is Low, Higher Low, Higher Low.

416
00:36:51,740 --> 00:36:54,260
High also gets higher, higher.

417
00:36:54,260 --> 00:36:59,119
But even though it can make it go up, it probably won't be strong.

418
00:36:59,119 --> 00:37:02,579
I analyze that it's not strong enough to go very far over there.

419
00:37:02,940 --> 00:37:05,820
Might come to around here, just past this high a little bit.

420
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:11,199
Then gradually form a downtrend on the other side instead.

421
00:37:13,980 --> 00:37:20,079
Now we come to estimating the waves that will occur in the future.

422
00:37:21,380 --> 00:37:25,980
We look at the consistency. 185, 274, 209.

423
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:30,780
On average, it should move around 200 if it continues up.

424
00:37:30,780 --> 00:37:33,380
Because this is an uptrend. See?

425
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:37,039
Low lifts throughout, High rises throughout.

426
00:37:37,660 --> 00:37:41,280
If the hypothesis of the trend still exists, it means

427
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:46,340
when there's a High, uh, Low that's higher here

428
00:37:46,340 --> 00:37:55,960
there's a chance for a High, uh, High that's even higher to occur.

429
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:59,880
Around 200 pips, plus or minus, around this.

430
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:10,079
Now the Trend will keep going according to the uptrend or downtrend direction, following the Concept theory.

431
00:38:10,740 --> 00:38:21,960
Until the Concept is violated, then we can say there's a chance for that trend to change.

432
00:38:23,579 --> 00:38:27,699
The candlestick patterns we used to memorize before, various reversal candlesticks

433
00:38:28,260 --> 00:38:31,900
Candlesticks don't indicate that the Trend will change or reverse.

434
00:38:31,900 --> 00:38:34,719
They just indicate a reversal in that specific price range only.

435
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:41,119
Like when we see a reversal candlestick, a Pinbar just reverses this much. It doesn't say

436
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:46,760
that the trend changes. Like where's good? Like here, this Pinbar

437
00:38:47,580 --> 00:38:51,760
drops down then rises back up. It doesn't mean that when you see a Pinbar or reversal candlestick pattern

438
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:58,699
it will become an uptrend from a downtrend. It just changes the angle.

439
00:38:58,699 --> 00:39:02,739
The angle of price, making swing high swing low, that's all, and it still follows the same trend.

440
00:39:04,460 --> 00:39:08,980
The market moves in trends, Dow Theory point 2 says this, therefore

441
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:12,659
You must believe it's a trend, and trade with the trend.

442
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:16,079
And it will change trend only when it changes trend.

443
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:18,559
Saying it like this sounds confusing but it's really like this.

444
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:21,900
For it to change, it must violate the theory.

445
00:39:21,900 --> 00:39:23,679
Contradict it.

446
00:39:25,700 --> 00:39:27,320
Lower High, Lower High, Lower High.

447
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:28,940
Lower Low, Lower Low, Lower Low.

448
00:39:28,940 --> 00:39:32,619
What should follow the downtrend direction?

449
00:39:33,020 --> 00:39:35,420
Lower High, Lower High, continuously lower.

450
00:39:35,420 --> 00:39:39,619
But it makes a High that's higher than the previous High here. See?

451
00:39:40,380 --> 00:39:44,900
This is violating, violating the theory.

452
00:39:46,100 --> 00:39:54,380
Therefore, there's a chance that it will change trend. Using the word chance.

453
00:39:54,380 --> 00:40:00,079
Must keep watching. Don't see just this and assume it's certain. It might just be temporary then drop again.

454
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:05,079
Therefore, we need to watch. When it pulls back, we look at the rise that we pair up like we learned from the beginning, rises

455
00:40:05,079 --> 00:40:13,519
If it pulls back, pulls back and gets a lower, uh, gets here, gets a Higher Low, a low that's higher than this low.

456
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:21,760
One, two, three, we get 3 components already. Low, High, Higher Low.

457
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:27,599
If it continues moving higher than this High, becoming a Higher High, it's an uptrend.

458
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:34,019
The trend change happens around this time, or it might drop, not stay here.

459
00:40:34,019 --> 00:40:40,980
It might drop all the way here, but not lower than this, not lower than this original Low, then it rises again.

460
00:40:42,660 --> 00:40:50,299
Until it's higher than this High, it's also an uptrend. The theory concept is when the wave breaks out of the concept.

461
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:53,760
Of downtrend and then uptrend.

462
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:58,139
If the pattern comes to this point really, it will fit the pattern that

463
00:40:58,139 --> 00:41:01,059
we remember as Double Bottom.

464
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:06,119
A W shape. Two bottom points then the trend changes upward.

465
00:41:07,180 --> 00:41:11,119
According to theory, they consider the W pattern

466
00:41:12,020 --> 00:41:15,519
in a downtrend, if Double Bottom occurs, it's a Pattern

467
00:41:15,980 --> 00:41:24,599
for trend change. But really, if we take the real thing, there will be a price or wave that warns us first that it might change.

468
00:41:24,599 --> 00:41:45,500
It's this wave that breaks through the High, breaks through the concept. See? Higher than this High.

469
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:49,500
The Low doesn't have a lifted low anymore. It has a suddenly lower low appearing like this.

470
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:55,699
Like this example, it's clearly lower, it's clearly a downtrend.

471
00:41:56,380 --> 00:42:00,460
If this doesn't go up and drops with the downtrend, clearly it has changed.

472
00:42:02,020 --> 00:42:04,780
It's a warning signal. Simply put, we look at warning signals.

473
00:42:05,180 --> 00:42:15,820
If you've been happily playing Buy, holding long, and you see a warning signal, prepare to sell out, close TP already. Something like that.

474
00:42:15,820 --> 00:42:23,599
If you keep holding, it might come back to the point where you bought. Same if you've been selling, held it, it might come back up.

475
00:42:24,519 --> 00:42:29,460
It's a warning. However you say it, it's a warning. Remember this signal, End of Trend.

476
00:42:29,460 --> 00:42:33,579
And that's the end of this Part on the topic of Trends in Dow Theory for now.

477
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:39,880
Next time we meet, we'll take everything and combine it all together, then we'll analyze charts together.

478
00:42:40,100 --> 00:42:43,960
That will be very fun and you'll understand much more.

479
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:46,539
Okay, thank you very much. Goodbye.
