00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:01,580
Hello everyone.

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:04,799
In this Part, we'll continue with

3
00:00:05,259 --> 00:00:07,960
Price Action, focusing on Support and Resistance.

4
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:13,160
After we've learned and understood about candlesticks

5
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:14,099
from

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:15,900
the previous Parts

7
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:20,300
whether it's reading Momentum, reading candlesticks like we're telling a story

8
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:23,500
like scenes in a movie

9
00:00:24,399 --> 00:00:27,420
battlefield, or whatever comparison you want to make.

10
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:29,519
Now let's continue with Support and Resistance.

11
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:32,439
This will make reading our charts

12
00:00:32,439 --> 00:00:34,320
or Price Action, which is

13
00:00:34,619 --> 00:00:37,340
the action of price, the movement of price

14
00:00:37,799 --> 00:00:39,520
much clearer than reading

15
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:43,100
candlesticks alone.

16
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:45,979
Let's get started.

17
00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:50,700
Price Action isn't just about Support and Resistance.

18
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:54,299
There are about 3-5 patterns.

19
00:00:54,299 --> 00:00:58,820
I'll show you the really interesting ones.

20
00:01:01,659 --> 00:01:03,420
First of all, Support and Resistance

21
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:08,579
Type 1: Horizontal.

22
00:01:08,579 --> 00:01:11,060
The word horizontal, a horizontal level like this.

23
00:01:14,079 --> 00:01:21,719
First, view it as a price zone. The concept is to see it as a price zone, not as a single line or single price.

24
00:01:21,719 --> 00:01:24,599
View it as a price range, as a zone, covering an area.

25
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:31,579
If it's above, we call it Resistance. If it's below the price, we call it Support.

26
00:01:31,579 --> 00:01:36,739
The meaning, if we go by pure theory, it would be too much. Let's keep it short.

27
00:01:37,459 --> 00:01:43,879
Resistance, to translate it simply in Price Action or price terms, it resists

28
00:01:43,879 --> 00:01:47,200
and prevents it from going up. Simple. It's like a wall.

29
00:01:48,099 --> 00:02:05,260
It's like a barrier. When price comes up and hits it, there's resistance.

30
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:09,479
Or a price wall. As for Support, the meaning is literal.

31
00:02:09,639 --> 00:02:15,159
It supports and prevents it from going down. That's the concept. Resistance prevents upward movement.

32
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:22,139
If Support means it supports and prevents downward movement. Now, how do we create Support

33
00:02:22,139 --> 00:02:26,460
and Resistance levels? Look at Swing Points.

34
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:30,680
The term Swing Point means it goes up then goes down.

35
00:02:31,159 --> 00:02:34,280
If it's in the middle of price movement like this, we won't use it.

36
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:36,840
Use where it reverses.

37
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:40,120
Because it means it must have hit something, couldn't continue

38
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:42,439
and had to go in the other direction. Right?

39
00:02:43,199 --> 00:02:46,280
Like these, it hits then continues on.

40
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:52,300
We won't use these as Support or Resistance. When it can't continue and bounces back

41
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:59,479
hits and bounces back, we'll use these. Like this, can't continue, reverses down. Comes down, can't

42
00:02:59,479 --> 00:03:04,699
continue, reverses up. Every Swing Point like this, we'll use as Support or Resistance.

43
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:09,000
If it's above, it definitely resists upward movement. Above must be Resistance.

44
00:03:09,219 --> 00:03:11,659
Below, it supports and prevents downward movement, so it must be Support.

45
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:20,000
And as I said from the start, count it as a zone, not drawing a single line as a price.

46
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:28,560
Support and Resistance, according to their meaning, is resisting and preventing downward movement.

47
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:33,360
This means Resistance often has price reversals

48
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,800
when it's been rising, rising, rising

49
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,879
and when it hits, it reverses down.

50
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:40,180
Support is the same.

51
00:03:41,099 --> 00:03:43,319
It keeps dropping, dropping, dropping down.

52
00:03:43,319 --> 00:03:45,699
When it hits Support, it supports and prevents downward movement.

53
00:03:45,699 --> 00:03:47,340
According to the concept's name.

54
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:50,460
Support, it means there's a chance

55
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:53,120
let's use the word "chance." There's a chance it will reverse upward.

56
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:56,539
Away from the original direction that was coming down to hit Support.

57
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:59,680
As for Resistance, away from the original direction that was coming up to hit Resistance

58
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,800
which is the opposite direction, which is down.

59
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:05,139
There's usually a price reversal by

60
00:04:05,699 --> 00:04:07,479
reading it together with candlesticks.

61
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:09,500
See? Pinbar.

62
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:12,400
Pinbar going down, right? Down.

63
00:04:13,539 --> 00:04:16,860
This one's a group, but if you combine them, it becomes a Pinbar too.

64
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:21,639
In the principle of combining candlesticks that we learned in the earlier Parts.

65
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:28,199
Therefore, Support and Resistance, we'll use them together with candlesticks that show buying or selling pressure.

66
00:04:29,379 --> 00:04:34,199
If the candlesticks we know, that we learned in the candlestick Part

67
00:04:34,199 --> 00:04:44,379
if we encounter them in the middle of the chart, they won't really produce results according to their names, like reversal candlesticks and such.

68
00:04:44,379 --> 00:04:56,240
Candlesticks will have clear effects only when they're found in areas that are Support or Resistance zones. Only then will they clearly produce those expected results.

69
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:08,040
Which case? Like coming down and encountering a candle like this. This isn't a Pinbar. Where is it?

70
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:15,660
And if it's not in a Support or Resistance zone, like this

71
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:22,480
Pinbar shows buying pressure returning. Dropping, dropping, dropping, but why doesn't it reverse back up like this?

72
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,540
Because it's in the middle of a trend. It's not in a Support or Resistance area.

73
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:30,100
Like this, see? When it's here, it goes up.

74
00:05:30,819 --> 00:05:35,319
See? It produces clearer effects. Simply put.

75
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,480
Another concept of Support and Resistance you need to know is

76
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:46,920
originally, if it's above like this, price moves up and hits it.

77
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:52,860
Coming from below up to hit above, that's called Resistance. Right?

78
00:05:53,480 --> 00:06:00,100
But whenever Resistance is broken through upward, when price breaks through upward

79
00:06:00,839 --> 00:06:05,779
it immediately switches from Resistance, its role changes, to become Support.

80
00:06:05,779 --> 00:06:12,079
From originally resisting upward movement, preventing upward movement

81
00:06:12,079 --> 00:06:16,300
when it breaks through, simply put, the resistance couldn't hold, it broke.

82
00:06:16,819 --> 00:06:19,980
Breaks up. When it reverses back down

83
00:06:20,519 --> 00:06:23,860
what used to be Resistance will change to become Support, supporting and preventing downward movement.

84
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:26,560
In the same level, same zone.

85
00:06:26,939 --> 00:06:29,819
Comes down. Retest, simply put, comes down to test.

86
00:06:31,939 --> 00:06:34,579
Resisted upward movement, got broken through, damaged.

87
00:06:34,959 --> 00:06:38,259
Therefore, it's no longer Resistance because it's below the price.

88
00:06:38,259 --> 00:06:41,480
It becomes Support, according to its name. Supports and prevents downward movement.

89
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:45,000
So it becomes a reversal point to continue.

90
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:47,579
It will change its role. Like this one is Support.

91
00:06:48,079 --> 00:06:52,019
Supports preventing downward movement, bounces up. Supports preventing downward movement, bounces up.

92
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:55,579
Finally, it gets destroyed. From Support it becomes Resistance.

93
00:06:55,959 --> 00:06:59,279
Price comes back up to retest, comes up to hit again.

94
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:03,519
So originally it supported preventing downward movement.

95
00:07:03,519 --> 00:07:07,199
When it's damaged and broken, it means it got broken through downward.

96
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:10,120
It will change its role to become Resistance preventing upward movement.

97
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:14,100
Come here. Understand the concept and remember it.

98
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:15,560
Then it drops.

99
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,600
Here, this is Support.

100
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:22,839
This breaks down. Support changes to Resistance.

101
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:26,360
Comes up to hit, and the same point that used to be Support before

102
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:29,319
now resists preventing upward movement, then drops.

103
00:07:29,319 --> 00:07:34,579
Down. This is the role of Support and Resistance.

104
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:37,879
Like in this picture, it's also Support and Resistance.

105
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:40,779
But it's like the trend we've been seeing.

106
00:07:40,779 --> 00:07:44,100
It's a trend.

107
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:46,000
This might be a clearer trend.

108
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,420
Going up step by step like stairs.

109
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:50,439
Hits, then hits and drops.

110
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:52,459
This is Support, bounces up.

111
00:07:52,459 --> 00:07:59,759
Goes and breaks through, right? Breaks through, then hits a new barrier, which might have existed before.

112
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:07,839
It drops. When it comes down here, what was this? It was Resistance, got broken through, switches its role to become Support, supports preventing downward movement.

113
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:14,300
It continues up. This one used to resist, couldn't hold, got broken through. Reverses down, it supports preventing downward movement.

114
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:22,620
Changes role. Breaks through again, goes up to hit Resistance, comes down to hit Support, that's how its steps continue like this.

115
00:08:25,279 --> 00:08:32,500
And the principle for drawing good Support and Resistance is to start from the larger timeframe down.

116
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:38,220
Like this will be a weekly timeframe, a weekly chart, weekly graph, this is Resistance.

117
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:42,379
See? It's a major level. Go ahead and draw it. It's a zone, a Support zone.

118
00:08:42,379 --> 00:08:48,379
When it zooms down to daily, if it moves up and hits here, and forms a reversal candlestick pattern

119
00:08:48,379 --> 00:08:53,460
like this, it's around this area that belongs to

120
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:56,740
a larger timeframe. Therefore, it will be thick, solid, as a

121
00:08:56,740 --> 00:08:59,399
strong Resistance. Using the word "strong," how many points?

122
00:08:59,399 --> 00:09:04,039
Count them. One, two, three, four, five. The word "strong" means there's

123
00:09:04,039 --> 00:09:06,440
it's been hit multiple times already, whether Support or Resistance.

124
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:09,139
Using the term hit multiple times, price has hit and crashed into it.

125
00:09:09,419 --> 00:09:12,620
But couldn't break through. If it's Resistance, couldn't break up.

126
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:14,179
If it's Support, couldn't break down.

127
00:09:14,179 --> 00:09:17,220
That shows the level is even stronger.

128
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:22,320
This is why it drops so much, so far, after hitting Resistance.

129
00:09:23,379 --> 00:09:30,620
Let's look at a real chart for a bit. A real chart. Look at the points.

130
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:35,500
This head, draw it like this. This is horizontal.

131
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:39,240
Our horizontal lines, we're talking about horizontal, so draw them.

132
00:09:41,059 --> 00:09:49,059
This is drawing from what we see. But if we do it properly, know the history first.

133
00:09:50,379 --> 00:09:54,259
Suppose I'm comfortable trading the 1-hour timeframe.

134
00:09:55,059 --> 00:09:59,139
I'll take the larger one to control first, which is 4-hour.

135
00:10:01,759 --> 00:10:07,240
This is the point where it swung, came down then reversed up forming a tail showing returning strength.

136
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:13,059
Then go back to the past. See? There's this point where it came down and went up.

137
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:20,259
Here it hit and went up. This shows this level works. So we draw it for the 4-hour.

138
00:10:22,279 --> 00:10:27,139
Where else? Like here it has bounces. This is interesting. See?

139
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:32,679
Comes up, hits and drops. What role did it play, remember?

140
00:10:32,679 --> 00:10:36,679
It was Resistance, resisted upward movement. Finally the Resistance broke, broke through.

141
00:10:36,879 --> 00:10:40,659
Reverses back. What is it now? From Resistance it changed to Support.

142
00:10:40,659 --> 00:10:46,000
Supports preventing downward movement. Can't go down, so it goes up. See?

143
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:50,120
But there's another thing I mentioned, don't forget.

144
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:52,419
We don't look at it as a single line.

145
00:10:52,419 --> 00:10:56,200
Not taking this price, a single price. It's not this price that is Support or Resistance.

146
00:10:57,019 --> 00:11:00,340
We take it as a zone. Like this, if you draw it as a zone

147
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:03,759
it becomes clearer like this. See?

148
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:07,879
This, it touches the zone, touches the zone, touches the zone a bit.

149
00:11:07,879 --> 00:11:22,399
And finally it stays. And comes down touching the zone.

150
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:28,820
Resistance is here, this zone. You can combine them all this way, combine them all.

151
00:11:29,379 --> 00:11:33,659
Like this. It hits and drops, hits and drops, hits and drops. See?

152
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:39,360
So we mark it like this. After marking on the larger timeframe

153
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:44,940
we'll break it down to smaller timeframes, well, smaller ones

154
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,700
and mark what we just saw. Look at the left side.

155
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:50,360
This is our left side. Here's where the current price is running on the chart.

156
00:11:50,659 --> 00:11:52,700
So we look back at the past.

157
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:55,919
The points where it clearly bounced up. Here.

158
00:11:55,919 --> 00:12:14,980
We mark and set them up.

159
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:18,720
If the line is above the price, that means it's Resistance.

160
00:12:19,059 --> 00:12:28,480
Therefore, if price breaks through this Resistance upward

161
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:34,279
Breaks through. Price runs, boom, breaks up.

162
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:40,200
Where will it go next? It'll be clear, right? There's nothing blocking it anymore.

163
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:44,299
Price will keep running until it hits the next Resistance.

164
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,340
The next level.

165
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:53,139
When price goes up and hits it, we need to watch at that moment to see if price

166
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:56,559
will hit and pass through, or if it doesn't pass then

167
00:12:58,179 --> 00:13:00,919
it'll reverse down. Look at the candlesticks.

168
00:13:01,419 --> 00:13:03,879
Reverses back down. Look, this is the old Resistance.

169
00:13:04,259 --> 00:13:07,419
Already broken through. It becomes Support. Comes down to test Support.

170
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:10,419
Right here. Boom.

171
00:13:13,379 --> 00:13:16,659
Comes to test if it holds.

172
00:13:17,379 --> 00:13:20,399
Right. It holds.

173
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:24,220
It holds. If it holds, price returns.

174
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:26,460
Goes back up.

175
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:32,860
If there's a lot of buying pressure, it might break through this Resistance.

176
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:36,240
Could break out. Break out like this, could go far.

177
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:42,320
If it breaks, where will it go? To the next Resistance. Right here.

178
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:50,220
Goes and hits it. Resistance does its job resisting upward movement. Then it'll curve down again.

179
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:53,799
It'll reverse downward again. It'll keep going like this.

180
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:59,840
Understand now? Support and Resistance in horizontal form.

181
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:03,580
You mark where you see repeated points.

182
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:07,100
Like three or so. For example, when I mark here, did I mark this correctly?

183
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:11,580
We haven't seen what's behind yet. Based on what we see now, it should hit this line.

184
00:14:12,299 --> 00:14:18,919
This is Support, comes down and bounces, comes down and bounces up, breaks through, breaks through, comes back. This level must become Resistance, right?

185
00:14:18,919 --> 00:14:24,139
And it comes up here. It resists down, resists down, resists down. Finally

186
00:14:24,139 --> 00:14:29,720
it breaks down. All the way here. Reached this major Support zone.

187
00:14:30,139 --> 00:14:34,639
Very clear Support. When it hits, see? It holds and prevents it from dropping.

188
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:39,139
It holds and bounces up like this. See? Now if it can break through

189
00:14:39,139 --> 00:14:43,460
Boom, breaks down. Down. It reverses back up and hits this zone.

190
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:46,659
This Resistance zone. Originally it was Support. Already broken.

191
00:14:46,659 --> 00:14:52,019
Change its name. It becomes Resistance. It resists, prevents upward movement. So it drops.

192
00:14:52,019 --> 00:14:59,039
Price drops. Hits there and drops out. Here. Now if we try to look back

193
00:14:59,039 --> 00:15:07,080
Let me look back. Here, here, here, here, here. See? Hit here again. This zone again.

194
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:11,460
This zone again. See? Hits and drops. Comes down and hits. Here and goes up. Bounces, bounces, bounces.

195
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:17,000
Until it's able to break through. Here it reverses up to hit again. Here. See? Here.

196
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:21,820
About this much is good enough. Looks like it broke through a bit, but couldn't continue.

197
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:26,919
So it drops like this. Still counts because like I said, Support and Resistance aren't viewed as a single price line.

198
00:15:26,919 --> 00:15:30,940
It's a Price Zone. Like this. Like this. See?

199
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:36,700
Here. Here. We didn't know before. We don't know what's behind. We mark what we see now.

200
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:40,019
Based on current data, these 3 points didn't break. Mark here first.

201
00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:46,519
Here too. Right. Once we mark it, it misses. After it misses, we look back to see if this level is really strong.

202
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:52,820
It all checks out. This is a zone, see? It doesn't reach exactly, but remember it's a zone.

203
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:56,080
It's a Price Zone. So it drops like this.

204
00:15:56,580 --> 00:16:00,240
Therefore, this line should be fairly strong.

205
00:16:00,539 --> 00:16:02,960
Therefore, if price, or here, comes up to hit here

206
00:16:03,899 --> 00:16:09,320
we analyze or consider the trend

207
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:12,080
that there's a chance it won't break on the first try.

208
00:16:12,419 --> 00:16:14,320
Might reverse back first.

209
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:17,139
Come to form new patterns, then go up.

210
00:16:17,559 --> 00:16:21,000
This is the point where we'll consider buying or selling pressure

211
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:25,240
to see who wins, who dominates more, from what we learned about

212
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:29,559
about reading candlesticks. We look at it together with

213
00:16:29,559 --> 00:16:31,840
this right here. We'll see a clearer picture than when we first

214
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:50,980
learned about candlesticks. We read them candle by candle.

215
00:16:51,799 --> 00:16:58,639
Like before, we read by going up, until we reach here. Reading here, it's strong. Selling pressure is strong. Probably won't hold.

216
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:05,140
Reading down, up, up, down, and so on. Reading continuously, there was no, basically no focal point.

217
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:09,200
There might be a percentage that makes our reading and analysis of candlesticks

218
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:12,480
or buying/selling pressure or Momentum

219
00:17:13,279 --> 00:17:15,839
less accurate. But if combined with Support and Resistance

220
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:18,819
it's a level we already know that it must play an important role where

221
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:21,039
price must do something in these zones.

222
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:22,819
If we compare it to

223
00:17:22,819 --> 00:17:28,140
like comparing to the candlestick lessons we learned, Momentum as a battlefield

224
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:31,900
there are 2 cities fighting each other, to seize territory

225
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:33,839
who can enter whose territory more

226
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:39,039
Support and Resistance are like city walls or checkpoint walls.

227
00:17:39,559 --> 00:17:42,880
So when it's a checkpoint wall, that means the wall must have who?

228
00:17:43,539 --> 00:17:46,880
Must have soldiers guarding, obstacles blocking, right?

229
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:50,880
So we need to look at the forces battling there to see if they can destroy the wall.

230
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:55,000
This side, the city on this side, if it's an uptrend going up to hit Resistance, we need to see if

231
00:17:55,579 --> 00:17:59,539
the army attacking, coming to assault, does it have strong or weak forces?

232
00:17:59,539 --> 00:18:05,299
Is it at full strength or is it weakening? Against the army waiting to defend on the wall

233
00:18:05,299 --> 00:18:09,940
at this level that already exists. Will this side be able to resist?

234
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:15,819
Can they push the enemy back? We'll know step by step.

235
00:18:16,079 --> 00:18:19,700
Instead of reading candlesticks continuously from what we learned about Momentum

236
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:21,920
which already gives us information as a story

237
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:25,539
if we understand from the previous lessons, from previous parts

238
00:18:25,539 --> 00:18:28,980
we can already read Momentum and candlesticks as a continuous story.

239
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:32,160
When we combine it with Support and Resistance as zones

240
00:18:33,359 --> 00:18:38,799
it tells us exactly which points we should focus our reading on more.

241
00:18:39,140 --> 00:18:43,279
Instead of reading through dozens of candles, which might be confusing

242
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:47,319
information might be wrong or inaccurate. But if we already know the positions we need to focus on

243
00:18:47,319 --> 00:18:50,980
we just read buying or selling pressure at the moments when there are Support and Resistance

244
00:18:51,359 --> 00:18:55,200
positions like these instead. It'll save us more time.

245
00:18:55,579 --> 00:18:59,900
But if you want the overall picture or want to analyze more deeply

246
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:03,900
we read like we read before

247
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:06,880
from previous lessons, read through the entire set, read continuously

248
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:12,039
but at points where you encounter Support and Resistance, analyze more specifically

249
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:15,220
whether it will go or not go.

250
00:19:15,859 --> 00:19:21,079
Because if it goes, it must go to the next level. Each level basically tells us, besides preventing upward movement

251
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:32,259
like I said before, this is the city wall. If the forces attack and break through

252
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:38,619
the next wall is here. Now you ask, what happens in this zone?

253
00:19:38,619 --> 00:19:40,960
It doesn't do much. The troops just keep advancing

254
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:45,779
to attack the next wall or next city. That's it, to seize the new city and keep attacking forward.

255
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:50,279
If we compare it to warfare, it's exactly like this. It's normal.

256
00:19:50,279 --> 00:19:53,539
In the function of Support like this, it holds price from dropping

257
00:19:53,539 --> 00:19:59,099
so if it drops through, it broke this wall already, so it must go attack the next city wall which is the next zone.

258
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:02,779
Send the soldiers. When soldiers reach the next wall zone

259
00:20:02,779 --> 00:20:20,259
the troops from this side send forces to fight, to fight and reclaim the territory back.

260
00:20:20,259 --> 00:20:22,539
That's why they defend to prevent us from entering their territory too.

261
00:20:23,259 --> 00:20:25,359
Hit, hit, hit, down, down

262
00:20:26,099 --> 00:20:27,140
So we analyze like this.

263
00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:28,660
If it drops, where does it go?

264
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:33,119
If the forces from below try to push up and lose

265
00:20:34,599 --> 00:20:36,779
they'll retreat as normal. If we go fight

266
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:40,059
and we lose, or we can't fight anymore, we're exhausted

267
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:41,819
where do we have to go?

268
00:20:42,759 --> 00:20:44,980
We have to return to our base, return to our army camp.

269
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:49,079
The question is, if we fight here and can't hold, we must return to Support level where it was before

270
00:20:49,079 --> 00:20:53,200
like we go back, go rest first. It already won here before, we're defending here

271
00:20:53,200 --> 00:21:14,960
right? This is considered their city wall. But fighting here doesn't work anymore.

272
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:21,160
When the army advances this big, like a wall appears, it protects the zone.

273
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:25,460
Taking that zone becomes the zone they're holding, according to the size of their candle.

274
00:21:25,859 --> 00:21:31,539
When price hits and can't break through, encountered this level before, they retreat back.

275
00:21:33,519 --> 00:21:36,980
See this huge candle? Remember?

276
00:21:38,319 --> 00:21:43,720
If suddenly there are small candles and then a big candle appears from the start

277
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:50,740
that's it, the trend will go in the big candle's direction for a while. So see? When it comes, it goes this way again.

278
00:21:50,740 --> 00:21:58,640
It sends forces this way again. Like it can't fight back, right? So it keeps sending the same army here.

279
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:13,700
They move the army, move the army here, attack, attack inward, attack until the defending forces can't hold anymore.

280
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:33,240
Keep going continuously.

281
00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:37,920
See? It's like in this area, after breaking through for a while

282
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:41,079
in this area they have new forces forming a wall right here.

283
00:22:41,079 --> 00:22:44,480
How did this happen? If you look back at this line, this line

284
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:48,099
See here? It bounces back.

285
00:22:50,359 --> 00:22:54,640
This is this zone. Hit then drop, struggling here, hit

286
00:22:56,539 --> 00:22:57,480
This one

287
00:22:57,480 --> 00:23:04,500
This shows they still have military forces waiting

288
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:13,099
waiting to fight. That's why it must bounce. The army is coming. Simply put, they might be tired from traveling.

289
00:23:13,619 --> 00:23:16,980
Momentum starts decreasing, the big candles start getting smaller and smaller and smaller.

290
00:23:18,180 --> 00:23:22,940
Trying their best to push but in the end might start weakening.

291
00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:29,920
Then small green candles gradually creep up, and finally defeat this army.

292
00:23:30,359 --> 00:23:35,539
See? Price manages to close above this one. So keep fighting. Fight to where?

293
00:23:36,079 --> 00:23:39,220
Fight back to where they just crossed over the city wall here.

294
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:52,920
This first checkpoint wall. Come here, then go back up to reclaim it.

295
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:56,460
Make it ours again, so the enemy doesn't reclaim it.

296
00:23:56,460 --> 00:24:00,660
Hit then drop, hit then drop, hit then drop, trying to reclaim it.

297
00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:05,980
Still can't reclaim it yet of course, because here it's still considered in the period of

298
00:24:07,019 --> 00:24:12,019
sideways. Still fighting each other on this level. Here might be winning a bit

299
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:16,079
then shifts to the next Resistance level, which is here. Still fighting.

300
00:24:16,079 --> 00:24:21,359
It's just the strength of Momentum, candlesticks, like we've read before

301
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:30,339
it'll make analysis easier, clearer, increase your trading percentage even more.

302
00:24:30,339 --> 00:24:32,200
Let's continue watching.

303
00:24:35,579 --> 00:24:38,920
Next up is Dynamic Support and Resistance, or the sloped type.

304
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:50,680
Earlier, Support and Resistance were horizontal, right? Now the sloped type, how is it? It's trendlines basically.

305
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:58,079
Let me open a new one, let's say this one works.

306
00:25:06,859 --> 00:25:07,279
Let's continue.

307
00:25:07,279 --> 00:25:08,259
This one I like Fuji.

308
00:25:09,380 --> 00:25:16,539
We can look at this one.

309
00:25:17,559 --> 00:25:20,000
At first, this one already went like this.

310
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:21,319
See, it's a zone?

311
00:25:22,339 --> 00:25:23,299
The horizontal one.

312
00:25:23,299 --> 00:25:27,700
Bouncing for a long period because if you know

313
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:30,400
it switches roles, from Support to Resistance.

314
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:34,299
Goes up, hits, drops. See?

315
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,960
Now we move to the horizontal type, we already know that.

316
00:25:38,859 --> 00:25:44,099
Let's do the sloped type, the one with slope like this.

317
00:25:45,359 --> 00:25:45,960
Draw like this.

318
00:25:50,259 --> 00:25:54,559
If it's a downtrend, we'll draw from the peak downward like this.

319
00:25:56,079 --> 00:25:59,680
Then create a channel to make it parallel, let it run like this.

320
00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:07,400
You'll see it becomes Support and Resistance in diagonal form like this.

321
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:15,819
It's on top, it's a downtrend. So along this line

322
00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:20,380
it must be Resistance.

323
00:26:20,660 --> 00:26:23,880
Below, when it's below it becomes Support.

324
00:26:26,819 --> 00:26:29,819
When price comes to hit the lower line it becomes Support.

325
00:26:32,819 --> 00:26:34,539
This one first, Support like this.

326
00:26:50,380 --> 00:26:52,220
Here, right here

327
00:26:55,299 --> 00:27:04,619
Around here, see?

328
00:27:05,660 --> 00:27:09,380
When we draw trendlines, we'll draw two clear points first.

329
00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:10,500
Use this as point one.

330
00:27:11,519 --> 00:27:14,019
Point two, take a nearby point, nearby peak.

331
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:16,500
This one might be a bit off, skip it.

332
00:27:27,039 --> 00:27:31,859
We take this point and this point, these two points, then let the rest run.

333
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:40,539
For this we create a parallel channel at points it passed through before.

334
00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:47,720
The top will be Resistance. Price runs down, reverses back up.

335
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:53,559
Sometimes price reverses back and forth, we might not see on the horizontal axis

336
00:27:53,559 --> 00:27:58,039
why it bounces. Like here it might be struggling, not clear.

337
00:27:58,279 --> 00:28:04,940
Why does it drop? But actually here there's a little bit.

338
00:28:08,039 --> 00:28:17,200
Around here. They're fighting. Try looking back, is there anything? It's still not clear.

339
00:28:18,799 --> 00:28:24,119
Actually we can kind of see it in another technique which we'll cover later, which is Fibo.

340
00:28:24,759 --> 00:28:31,279
It happens to drop and retrace to around 55%, then it drops. But today we'll talk about it later.

341
00:28:32,380 --> 00:28:35,779
But since it already happened, we take the point where it occurred, this swing

342
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:40,819
and this swing, connect them together and extend it out.

343
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:45,519
It becomes a channel. Make the bottom parallel to be Support.

344
00:28:45,519 --> 00:28:46,980
We have Resistance already, now we'll have Support.

345
00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:53,019
That's why when price runs to hit Support or the diagonal line, it goes up.

346
00:28:54,859 --> 00:29:00,440
Hits, goes up, hits, hits. Goes down, down, down, down, down, down, hits again, then goes up. See?

347
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:04,960
Because if we want to know, wait, what's on the horizontal level that makes it go up?

348
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:10,799
It has to go up here. We can try observing this line.

349
00:29:19,299 --> 00:29:25,839
This line, this line, horizontal. Oh okay, because when it reverses back below, there's still a point where it must bounce.

350
00:29:30,740 --> 00:29:36,700
And it also has this line, so we can consider this one quite strong because there are 2 overlapping lines.

351
00:29:37,839 --> 00:29:44,480
Two stories, two types of Support and Resistance switching roles.

352
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:49,640
Switching roles. In an uptrend, is there an uptrend? Yeah, uptrend first.

353
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:53,079
This one here, then we take this point, this Low.

354
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:57,660
The clear one would be like this one.

355
00:30:00,740 --> 00:30:02,039
Let's zoom in a bit more.

356
00:30:03,819 --> 00:30:04,779
Want to make it clearer.

357
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:10,960
Draw a channel there.

358
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:17,940
The bottom will become Support.

359
00:30:21,259 --> 00:30:22,740
At this point we'll take it as point 2.

360
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:25,200
So we don't know if it's Support yet.

361
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:29,299
We have to wait for this formation to happen first, then we can draw it like this.

362
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:31,680
Once we draw it like this, it means we've got the top.

363
00:30:32,099 --> 00:30:34,240
So the top has to become Resistance, right?

364
00:30:35,660 --> 00:30:38,460
So when price runs from this point up,

365
00:30:39,079 --> 00:30:42,160
pretty strong momentum too, runs up strongly, and this green candle,

366
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:45,980
this long and big, boom! Hits Resistance.

367
00:30:47,299 --> 00:30:50,640
Still can't break through. That's why it curves down.

368
00:30:51,319 --> 00:30:54,140
Ah! Tests again, still can't break through.

369
00:30:54,140 --> 00:30:56,880
This one's like the final strike, boom!

370
00:30:57,619 --> 00:30:58,799
But you see,

371
00:30:58,799 --> 00:31:00,180
if we read by Momentum and candlesticks,

372
00:31:01,220 --> 00:31:04,200
it shows there's selling pressure, an Engulfing back.

373
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:06,720
The other side won't let it go through, simply put.

374
00:31:07,180 --> 00:31:09,680
So it reverses back because it's a Resistance zone.

375
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:14,200
Same thing, even though it's diagonal, we can still count it as a zone.

376
00:31:16,519 --> 00:31:18,740
Take the closing prices and the shadows, we can draw it.

377
00:31:20,740 --> 00:31:22,900
So it reverses back into the Channel.

378
00:31:23,759 --> 00:31:24,279
Like this.

379
00:31:26,420 --> 00:31:28,700
Then it comes down here, tests.

380
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:31,440
Tests Support, bounces up.

381
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:33,259
Goes up, comes back down to test again.

382
00:31:34,119 --> 00:31:43,519
Down here, tests, bounces, tests.

383
00:31:44,079 --> 00:31:53,440
See? It keeps testing Support.

384
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:58,099
This shows the diagonal line we drew

385
00:31:58,099 --> 00:32:03,500
is acting as Support.

386
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:07,500
When price hits it, it bounces.

387
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:12,599
But look at this area,

388
00:32:12,599 --> 00:32:18,299
when it breaks below Support,

389
00:32:18,859 --> 00:32:19,799
this Support line

390
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:26,660
will switch to become Resistance.

391
00:32:26,660 --> 00:32:30,759
See? Once it breaks below,

392
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:34,900
it tests from below, can't break through.

393
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:38,440
Tests again, can't break through.

394
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:45,900
This means the diagonal line switched roles

395
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:52,019
from Support to Resistance.

396
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:56,740
Same concept as horizontal Support/Resistance,

397
00:32:58,839 --> 00:33:02,619
just on a diagonal.

398
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:08,539
So whether it's horizontal or diagonal,

399
00:33:09,380 --> 00:33:14,339
Support and Resistance can switch roles.

400
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:24,200
This is what we call dynamic Support and Resistance.

401
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:32,180
Because it has a slope, it's not flat.

402
00:33:33,940 --> 00:33:37,559
It moves with the trend.

403
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:40,299
That's why we call it dynamic.

404
00:33:43,079 --> 00:33:44,400
Alright, so this is trendlines and channels.

405
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:49,799
Very useful for drawing Support and Resistance

406
00:33:49,799 --> 00:33:56,420
that moves with price.

407
00:33:57,740 --> 00:34:02,920
Now let's look at

408
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:08,940
another tool, which is

409
00:34:10,179 --> 00:34:16,659
Fibonacci.

410
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:21,599
Fibonacci, or Fibo for short,

411
00:34:21,599 --> 00:34:28,659
is a tool we use to find

412
00:34:28,659 --> 00:34:32,440
Support and Resistance zones too.

413
00:34:33,039 --> 00:34:46,639
But it's based on percentages

414
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:48,780
of the price movement.

415
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:52,199
The key levels are

416
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:55,019
23.6%, 38.2%, 50%,

417
00:34:56,860 --> 00:34:59,260
61.8%, and 78.6%.

418
00:34:59,260 --> 00:35:01,699
The most important is 61.8%,

419
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:02,639
also called the Golden Ratio.

420
00:35:04,380 --> 00:35:06,039
We use Fibo to measure

421
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,340
where price might pull back to.

422
00:35:09,340 --> 00:35:12,179
Let me show you how.

423
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:21,000
In an uptrend,

424
00:35:30,039 --> 00:35:34,059
we draw from Low to High.

425
00:35:34,820 --> 00:35:39,599
Like this swing here,

426
00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:46,800
from this Low

427
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:48,420
to this High.

428
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:58,800
Then when price pulls back,

429
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:16,619
we watch those Fibo levels

430
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:23,139
to see where it might bounce.

431
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:30,300
If it bounces at 38.2% or 50%,

432
00:36:31,639 --> 00:36:33,800
that's a shallow pullback.

433
00:36:34,619 --> 00:36:38,159
If it goes to 61.8%,

434
00:36:39,820 --> 00:36:43,280
that's a deeper pullback.

435
00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:47,300
If it breaks 61.8%,

436
00:36:48,179 --> 00:36:51,519
the trend might be weakening.

437
00:36:52,219 --> 00:36:54,059
In a downtrend, we do the opposite.

438
00:36:55,199 --> 00:36:58,460
Draw from High to Low.

439
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:00,099
Then watch for Resistance when it bounces.

440
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:07,960
Let's see an example.

441
00:37:11,300 --> 00:37:15,000
Here's an uptrend.

442
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:20,719
We draw Fibo from Low to High.

443
00:37:21,559 --> 00:37:25,920
Click the Fibo tool,

444
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:28,639
click at the Low,

445
00:37:28,639 --> 00:37:32,199
drag to the High.

446
00:37:32,199 --> 00:37:50,699
There, we get the levels.

447
00:37:52,239 --> 00:37:55,300
Now watch when price pulls back,

448
00:37:56,400 --> 00:38:02,380
where does it bounce?

449
00:38:04,179 --> 00:38:05,460
Look, it bounces right at 50%.

450
00:38:07,059 --> 00:38:07,659
like this tail

451
00:38:09,079 --> 00:38:10,719
they allow you to draw it like this

452
00:38:11,199 --> 00:38:14,340
you can draw the trendline because this is a swing point, see? Price came down then went up

453
00:38:14,619 --> 00:38:15,559
came down and went up

454
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:19,179
so you're allowed to draw and test it, because it's like

455
00:38:19,179 --> 00:38:21,739
it's a scare candle, reversed back down...

456
00:38:21,980 --> 00:38:26,400
went up, there's still no closing price that went beyond this line downward

457
00:38:26,739 --> 00:38:29,719
this is what we call discretionary, acceptable

458
00:38:31,559 --> 00:38:32,739
something like this is acceptable

459
00:38:32,739 --> 00:38:35,739
looks like it'll break through the trendline upward

460
00:38:36,260 --> 00:38:37,559
but it didn't actually break

461
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:39,019
see, it wicked up

462
00:38:39,780 --> 00:38:43,980
then reversed back down

463
00:38:44,519 --> 00:38:48,619
so this is considered

464
00:38:48,619 --> 00:38:51,199
acceptable, within discretion

465
00:38:51,199 --> 00:38:56,659
But if it clearly breaks through

466
00:38:56,659 --> 00:39:03,780
like breaking way up here

467
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:05,820
then coming back down

468
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:12,579
that wouldn't count anymore

469
00:39:12,579 --> 00:39:15,880
understand?

470
00:39:16,559 --> 00:39:20,119
So this is

471
00:39:20,239 --> 00:39:24,000
the trendline concept

472
00:39:25,300 --> 00:39:31,199
Drawing trendlines is about

473
00:39:31,199 --> 00:39:37,139
finding swing points

474
00:39:37,780 --> 00:39:43,239
When you connect swing points

475
00:39:43,599 --> 00:39:49,199
you get a trendline

476
00:39:49,199 --> 00:39:51,900
Once you have a trendline, you can

477
00:39:52,659 --> 00:39:57,400
use it to analyze price movement

478
00:39:57,400 --> 00:40:01,280
Like we'll wait for price to test this line

479
00:40:01,679 --> 00:40:12,340
when it comes to test

480
00:40:12,340 --> 00:40:14,500
if it bounces, we can trade it

481
00:40:15,079 --> 00:40:18,480
or wait for it to break through

482
00:40:19,340 --> 00:40:22,780
if it breaks, we trade the breakout

483
00:40:22,780 --> 00:40:24,980
That's how we use trendlines

484
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:28,980
Next, let's look at

485
00:40:30,219 --> 00:40:42,320
channels

486
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:49,219
Channels are drawn by

487
00:40:49,219 --> 00:40:58,940
taking the trendline concept

488
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:02,579
and adding a parallel line

489
00:41:02,579 --> 00:41:09,340
Like when we have an uptrend

490
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:16,840
we draw the trendline at the bottom

491
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:25,139
connecting swing lows

492
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:42,500
Then we draw a parallel line

493
00:41:44,780 --> 00:41:51,199
at the swing highs

494
00:41:51,199 --> 00:41:52,280
This creates a channel

495
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:03,940
Price moves within this channel

496
00:42:06,639 --> 00:42:10,780
bouncing between the upper and lower lines

497
00:42:10,780 --> 00:42:18,219
When we see a channel like this

498
00:42:18,219 --> 00:42:22,099
we can trade it

499
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:30,380
Buy at the lower line

500
00:42:30,380 --> 00:42:36,760
sell at the upper line

501
00:42:37,579 --> 00:42:47,539
or wait for a breakout

502
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:58,659
If price breaks above the channel

503
00:42:58,659 --> 00:43:09,500
that's a bullish breakout

504
00:43:10,679 --> 00:43:18,159
If it breaks below

505
00:43:22,159 --> 00:43:31,019
that's a bearish breakout

506
00:43:31,360 --> 00:43:36,059
Let's look at an example

507
00:43:36,659 --> 00:43:39,559
Here's a clear uptrend channel

508
00:43:39,980 --> 00:43:45,460
See how price

509
00:43:45,460 --> 00:43:48,579
keeps bouncing between the lines

510
00:43:48,579 --> 00:43:51,960
touches the bottom line

511
00:43:52,780 --> 00:43:56,980
bounces up

512
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:58,780
goes to the top line

513
00:44:01,579 --> 00:44:06,199
bounces down

514
00:44:06,980 --> 00:44:09,639
This creates a trading range

515
00:44:11,659 --> 00:44:12,500
within the channel

516
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:16,059
We can use this to plan our trades

517
00:44:16,840 --> 00:44:20,699
When price comes to the bottom

518
00:44:20,699 --> 00:44:24,059
we look for buy signals

519
00:44:24,179 --> 00:44:29,659
When it reaches the top

520
00:44:29,679 --> 00:44:33,880
we look for sell signals

521
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:38,500
or take profit

522
00:44:38,840 --> 00:44:42,099
Now let's see

523
00:44:43,860 --> 00:44:47,719
a downtrend channel

524
00:44:50,639 --> 00:44:54,440
In a downtrend

525
00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:59,000
we draw the trendline at the top

526
00:44:59,679 --> 00:45:04,139
connecting swing highs

527
00:45:04,860 --> 00:45:12,559
Then add a parallel line

528
00:45:12,860 --> 00:45:16,480
at the swing lows

529
00:45:18,440 --> 00:45:22,679
Price moves down within this channel

530
00:45:22,940 --> 00:45:30,679
Same concept, just inverted

531
00:45:38,599 --> 00:45:46,360
We can sell at the top line

532
00:45:48,639 --> 00:45:53,880
buy back at the bottom line

533
00:45:56,780 --> 00:46:02,820
or wait for a breakout

534
00:46:05,039 --> 00:46:10,340
The key thing about channels is

535
00:46:10,920 --> 00:46:14,119
they help us see

536
00:46:14,460 --> 00:46:20,960
the range price is moving in

537
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:40,320
and plan our entries and exits

538
00:46:40,320 --> 00:46:45,460
Now an important point

539
00:46:45,460 --> 00:46:47,519
about drawing channels

540
00:46:49,079 --> 00:46:53,599
Sometimes you'll see

541
00:46:54,980 --> 00:46:59,039
the channel isn't perfect

542
00:46:59,380 --> 00:47:04,840
Price might wick outside

543
00:47:04,840 --> 00:47:08,760
but not close outside

544
00:47:08,760 --> 00:47:13,420
That's still okay

545
00:47:13,639 --> 00:47:20,480
We use discretion here too

546
00:47:21,159 --> 00:47:25,219
As long as the closes

547
00:47:26,679 --> 00:47:27,619
stay within the channel

548
00:47:31,219 --> 00:47:32,099
we can still consider it valid

549
00:47:32,460 --> 00:47:35,199
Just like with trendlines

550
00:47:32,460 --> 00:47:35,199
If we explain the theory in detail, it'd be really long

551
00:47:36,900 --> 00:47:39,519
It's one of the

552
00:47:39,519 --> 00:47:44,239
technical tools

553
00:47:44,840 --> 00:47:49,420
that acts as psychological Support

554
00:47:49,420 --> 00:47:53,260
It has specific ratios

555
00:47:53,260 --> 00:47:56,980
The important ones are these

556
00:47:57,320 --> 00:47:59,840
38.2%, 50%, and 61.8%

557
00:48:01,500 --> 00:48:03,880
So when price moves up

558
00:48:05,300 --> 00:48:08,900
If it pulls back, there are 3 lines

559
00:48:08,900 --> 00:48:12,360
where price has a chance to bounce as Support or Resistance levels from Fibo

560
00:48:12,900 --> 00:48:16,519
So let's say price moves up like this

561
00:48:16,980 --> 00:48:20,760
When it pulls back

562
00:48:20,760 --> 00:48:22,460
It might bounce at 38.2%

563
00:48:22,760 --> 00:48:29,260
or 50%

564
00:48:31,139 --> 00:48:34,440
or 61.8%

565
00:48:35,480 --> 00:48:38,980
These are considered

566
00:48:38,980 --> 00:48:42,840
psychological levels

567
00:48:44,059 --> 00:48:50,039
that traders pay attention to

568
00:48:51,099 --> 00:48:53,860
It's like

569
00:48:55,500 --> 00:48:59,840
when price reaches these Fibonacci levels

570
00:49:01,039 --> 00:49:04,280
traders will watch to see if it'll bounce or break through

571
00:49:04,980 --> 00:49:09,320
But this is just a tool

572
00:49:09,659 --> 00:49:15,000
We still need to combine it with other things we've learned

573
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:18,820
like candlestick patterns

574
00:49:19,400 --> 00:49:22,440
price structure

575
00:49:22,900 --> 00:49:25,840
to confirm

576
00:49:26,739 --> 00:49:30,000
whether it'll really bounce at that level or not

577
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:33,539
Alright, so Fibonacci

578
00:49:34,820 --> 00:49:36,000
is one popular tool

579
00:49:40,679 --> 00:49:44,280
that many traders use

580
00:49:44,280 --> 00:49:48,400
Okay, next

581
00:49:49,800 --> 00:49:53,639
We'll talk about Trendlines

582
00:49:54,300 --> 00:49:56,599
Trendlines

583
00:49:58,079 --> 00:50:06,739
are lines we draw

584
00:50:06,739 --> 00:50:10,940
to connect price swing points

585
00:50:10,940 --> 00:50:14,579
For an uptrend

586
00:50:16,139 --> 00:50:18,320
we connect the lows

587
00:50:20,280 --> 00:50:23,579
the bottom points

588
00:50:23,960 --> 00:50:26,079
When we draw a line connecting them

589
00:50:26,079 --> 00:50:30,579
it becomes an uptrend line

590
00:50:31,159 --> 00:50:33,219
For a downtrend

591
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:34,920
we connect the highs

592
00:50:40,599 --> 00:50:43,139
the top points

593
00:50:43,900 --> 00:50:50,980
When price comes to test this line

594
00:50:50,980 --> 00:50:58,960
it often bounces

595
00:50:58,960 --> 00:51:04,860
So the trendline acts as Support or Resistance

596
00:51:05,219 --> 00:51:08,420
For example, if we draw an uptrend line

597
00:51:08,420 --> 00:51:14,159
Each time price pulls back to touch this line

598
00:51:15,079 --> 00:51:19,559
it tends to bounce up

599
00:51:19,559 --> 00:51:24,320
If it breaks through this trendline

600
00:51:24,320 --> 00:51:26,340
it signals that the trend might be changing

601
00:51:28,820 --> 00:51:32,480
might be weakening

602
00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:36,719
So trendlines

603
00:51:36,719 --> 00:51:41,320
are very important tools

604
00:51:41,539 --> 00:51:48,360
for identifying trend direction

605
00:51:49,780 --> 00:51:52,639
and finding entry points

606
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:55,139
Okay, next we have Channels

607
00:51:55,139 --> 00:51:56,820
Channels

608
00:51:57,340 --> 00:51:59,679
are when we draw parallel lines

609
00:52:00,480 --> 00:52:02,320
both top and bottom

610
00:52:02,320 --> 00:52:04,739
The bottom line is Support

611
00:52:05,940 --> 00:52:07,500
The top line is Resistance

612
00:52:09,079 --> 00:52:11,400
Price will oscillate

613
00:52:12,380 --> 00:52:21,139
bounce between these two lines

614
00:52:21,139 --> 00:52:29,619
When it hits the bottom, it bounces up

615
00:52:30,440 --> 00:52:36,920
When it hits the top, it bounces down

616
00:52:37,260 --> 00:52:42,519
This is called trading in a channel

617
00:52:42,519 --> 00:52:49,440
If price breaks out of the channel

618
00:52:59,619 --> 00:53:02,780
either breaking the top resistance

619
00:53:03,059 --> 00:53:06,739
or breaking the bottom support

620
00:53:09,659 --> 00:53:14,639
it signals a potential trend change

621
00:53:15,019 --> 00:53:19,019
or strong momentum in that direction

622
00:53:20,039 --> 00:53:26,539
So channels

623
00:53:50,179 --> 00:53:55,980
are great for range trading

624
00:53:56,719 --> 00:54:01,460
buying at support, selling at resistance

625
00:54:02,500 --> 00:54:08,059
Alright, these are the basic tools

626
00:54:08,440 --> 00:54:11,280
for finding Support and Resistance

627
00:54:13,360 --> 00:54:18,159
Whether it's horizontal levels

628
00:54:19,300 --> 00:54:47,619
Fibonacci retracement

629
00:54:48,159 --> 00:54:50,039
Trendlines

630
00:54:50,039 --> 00:54:56,539
or Channels

631
00:54:56,539 --> 00:55:02,960
They all serve the same purpose

632
00:55:04,179 --> 00:55:09,579
helping us find where price might

633
00:55:11,119 --> 00:55:14,699
bounce or reverse

634
00:55:16,440 --> 00:55:18,219
But remember

635
00:55:19,099 --> 00:55:21,039
these aren't 100% accurate

636
00:55:21,880 --> 00:55:25,280
Sometimes price breaks through

637
00:55:26,440 --> 00:55:29,699
Sometimes it bounces

638
00:55:29,699 --> 00:55:31,559
We need to combine them with

639
00:55:31,559 --> 00:55:35,199
candlestick patterns

640
00:55:35,199 --> 00:55:39,440
price structure

641
00:55:39,440 --> 00:55:43,239
and other confirmations

642
00:55:43,239 --> 00:55:47,059
to make better trading decisions

643
00:55:47,059 --> 00:56:01,539
Don't rely on just one tool

644
00:56:01,539 --> 00:56:05,519
Use multiple confirmations

645
00:56:05,519 --> 00:56:10,019
That'll increase our probability of success

646
00:56:10,159 --> 00:56:12,340
Okay, now let's look at

647
00:56:12,340 --> 00:56:17,300
some real chart examples

648
00:56:17,300 --> 00:56:24,860
so you can see how these work in practice

649
00:56:24,860 --> 00:56:29,179
Here we can see

650
00:56:30,780 --> 00:56:35,539
This is a clear uptrend

651
00:56:36,119 --> 00:56:40,119
Price keeps making higher highs

652
00:56:41,820 --> 00:56:47,219
and higher lows

653
00:56:52,679 --> 00:56:58,920
If we draw a trendline

654
00:56:59,780 --> 00:57:05,880
connecting these lows

655
00:57:13,900 --> 00:57:22,280
You'll see price respects this line

656
00:57:32,760 --> 00:57:35,659
Each pullback touches the trendline and bounces

657
00:57:35,659 --> 00:57:35,860
This shows the trend is still strong

658
00:57:35,880 --> 00:57:36,719
But look here

659
00:57:39,619 --> 00:57:41,760
When price breaks below the trendline

660
00:57:43,460 --> 00:57:44,480
it signals trend weakness

661
00:57:45,840 --> 00:57:47,579
After the break, price starts moving sideways

662
00:57:48,039 --> 00:57:49,519
or even reverses

663
00:57:53,219 --> 00:57:53,840
So trendline breaks

664
00:57:54,780 --> 00:57:55,219
are important signals to watch

665
00:57:56,159 --> 00:57:57,900
Here's another example

666
00:58:01,980 --> 00:58:02,480
This is a channel

667
00:58:05,179 --> 00:58:05,860
Price is bouncing between

668
00:58:05,860 --> 00:58:32,980
the upper resistance line

669
00:58:34,900 --> 00:58:40,119
and the lower support line

670
00:58:40,940 --> 00:58:54,440
Each time it touches the bottom, it bounces up

671
00:58:59,619 --> 00:59:10,960
Each time it touches the top, it bounces down

672
00:59:12,239 --> 00:59:15,579
Very clear pattern

673
00:59:15,579 --> 00:59:19,900
If we trade this channel

674
00:59:21,019 --> 00:59:26,320
we'd buy near the bottom support

675
00:59:26,760 --> 00:59:31,639
and sell near the top resistance

676
00:59:31,860 --> 00:59:34,880
But watch what happens here

677
00:59:35,219 --> 00:59:39,039
Price breaks above the channel

678
00:59:40,159 --> 00:59:45,340
That's a breakout signal

679
00:59:45,340 --> 00:59:46,940
After breaking out, price continues moving strongly upward

680
00:59:48,400 --> 00:59:52,179
This is why channel breakouts

681
00:59:52,179 --> 00:59:55,079
are important trading opportunities

682
00:59:56,099 --> 01:00:03,579
Now let's look at Fibonacci

683
01:00:04,659 --> 01:00:13,699
Here price made a strong move up

684
01:00:15,719 --> 01:00:23,900
Then it started pulling back

685
01:00:25,619 --> 01:00:28,280
If we draw Fibonacci from the low to the high

686
01:00:28,760 --> 01:00:30,760
We can see the retracement levels

687
01:00:31,260 --> 01:00:34,179
Look here, price pulled back

688
01:00:34,179 --> 01:00:36,840
and bounced right at the 61.8% level

689
01:00:37,639 --> 01:00:41,619
This is a common Fibo level

690
01:00:42,179 --> 01:00:43,820
where price often finds support

691
01:00:45,880 --> 01:00:47,579
After bouncing at 61.8%

692
01:00:47,579 --> 01:00:50,019
price continued moving up

693
01:00:50,019 --> 01:00:52,980
resuming the uptrend

694
01:00:53,460 --> 01:00:56,219
This shows how Fibonacci levels

695
01:00:56,219 --> 01:00:58,840
can help us find good entry points

696
01:00:58,840 --> 01:01:01,780
during pullbacks in a trend

697
01:01:01,780 --> 01:01:04,639
Alright, so these are practical examples

698
01:01:04,639 --> 01:01:09,500
of how to use these tools

699
01:01:09,500 --> 01:01:14,460
Now you can practice finding these patterns

700
01:01:19,139 --> 01:01:22,360
can't break through, meaning it can't push higher

701
01:01:22,360 --> 01:01:26,900
So here we might think, well, it might not make it

702
01:01:27,539 --> 01:01:31,800
Maybe it'll drop back down first? Let's wait and see? Or what?

703
01:01:32,159 --> 01:01:34,920
But we see another candlestick trying to break through

704
01:01:34,920 --> 01:01:38,320
Alright, so when it breaks through, we see the role switches

705
01:01:39,280 --> 01:01:42,719
from what was Resistance, now acting as Support

706
01:01:43,860 --> 01:01:50,480
See? When it breaks through, the role reverses

707
01:01:50,480 --> 01:01:55,579
supporting from below

708
01:01:55,579 --> 01:01:59,079
Then it bounces up again

709
01:01:59,420 --> 01:02:05,159
continuing the upward move

710
01:02:05,159 --> 01:02:10,360
Alright, so this shows how Support and Resistance

711
01:02:10,360 --> 01:02:13,940
can switch roles

712
01:02:13,940 --> 01:02:16,280
This concept is very important

713
01:02:18,079 --> 01:02:20,900
for understanding price movement

714
01:02:21,820 --> 01:02:23,159
Now let's look at another example

715
01:02:23,460 --> 01:02:24,420
This one combines multiple concepts

716
01:02:25,559 --> 01:02:27,920
Here we have a trendline

717
01:02:28,519 --> 01:02:31,280
which is diagonal Support

718
01:02:32,199 --> 01:02:33,920
The price keeps testing this line

719
01:02:34,260 --> 01:02:36,440
bouncing up each time

720
01:02:37,300 --> 01:02:39,480
This shows the trendline is strong

721
01:02:39,480 --> 01:02:42,059
because it's been tested multiple times

722
01:02:42,059 --> 01:02:47,739
Now look what happens when it breaks

723
01:02:47,739 --> 01:02:51,280
The trendline switches from Support

724
01:02:52,260 --> 01:02:57,380
to become Resistance

725
01:02:57,559 --> 01:02:58,219
See how the price tries to go back up

726
01:03:00,119 --> 01:03:05,039
but gets rejected at the old trendline

727
01:03:05,260 --> 01:03:11,480
This is a perfect example of role reversal

728
01:03:11,480 --> 01:03:14,840
The same line that was supporting

729
01:03:14,840 --> 01:03:18,199
is now resisting

730
01:03:18,199 --> 01:03:22,239
Alright, let's talk about channels

731
01:03:23,380 --> 01:03:35,019
A channel has two parallel lines

732
01:03:35,019 --> 01:03:39,860
The lower line is Support

733
01:03:39,860 --> 01:03:45,420
The upper line is Resistance

734
01:03:45,420 --> 01:03:51,760
The price moves between these two lines

735
01:03:51,760 --> 01:03:56,340
bouncing from Support to Resistance

736
01:03:57,400 --> 01:04:26,320
and back down again

737
01:04:26,320 --> 01:04:28,760
This is called channel trading

738
01:04:28,760 --> 01:04:33,980
When the price is at the bottom

739
01:04:34,900 --> 01:04:38,980
touching Support, we can buy

740
01:04:41,179 --> 01:04:42,380
When it reaches the top

741
01:04:44,500 --> 01:04:46,780
touching Resistance, we can sell

742
01:04:47,559 --> 01:04:50,840
This works as long as the channel holds

743
01:04:51,619 --> 01:04:54,179
But what happens if it breaks out?

744
01:04:54,920 --> 01:04:57,579
If it breaks above the upper line

745
01:04:58,260 --> 01:04:59,500
that Resistance becomes Support

746
01:04:59,500 --> 01:05:02,320
The same role reversal concept

747
01:05:02,320 --> 01:05:03,980
we've been talking about

748
01:05:04,800 --> 01:05:08,360
Now, there's one more thing

749
01:05:08,579 --> 01:05:14,239
about Support and Resistance zones

750
01:05:14,239 --> 01:05:18,340
Remember, we don't draw them as single lines

751
01:05:18,699 --> 01:05:24,900
We draw them as zones or areas

752
01:05:27,159 --> 01:05:41,900
Because the price doesn't respect exact levels

753
01:05:41,900 --> 01:05:52,039
It moves in zones

754
01:05:53,940 --> 01:06:03,019
So when you're drawing Support and Resistance

755
01:06:04,800 --> 01:06:07,199
don't try to be too precise

756
01:06:09,079 --> 01:06:12,739
Draw zones instead

757
01:06:13,739 --> 01:06:17,679
This gives you more flexibility

758
01:06:17,679 --> 01:06:22,079
and better accuracy

759
01:06:22,480 --> 01:06:27,000
Alright, let's look at some practical examples

760
01:06:28,219 --> 01:06:36,960
on real charts

761
01:06:37,559 --> 01:06:47,940
Here's a chart showing horizontal Support

762
01:06:54,280 --> 01:07:00,800
You can see the price bouncing multiple times

763
01:07:00,800 --> 01:07:06,380
from this zone

764
01:07:06,380 --> 01:07:10,480
Each bounce makes the Support stronger

765
01:07:10,480 --> 01:07:13,880
because more traders recognize it

766
01:07:13,880 --> 01:07:18,039
Now look at this Resistance zone

767
01:07:18,340 --> 01:07:22,940
The price tries to break through

768
01:07:26,340 --> 01:07:33,340
but gets pushed back down

769
01:07:34,199 --> 01:07:39,679
several times

770
01:07:40,019 --> 01:07:47,800
This shows the Resistance is strong

771
01:07:49,099 --> 01:07:58,039
Until finally, it breaks through

772
01:08:02,780 --> 01:08:05,219
with a strong bullish candlestick

773
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:15,280
Now watch what happens next

774
01:08:15,719 --> 01:08:18,439
The price pulls back

775
01:08:19,140 --> 01:08:23,319
to retest the old Resistance

776
01:08:23,500 --> 01:08:28,420
which is now acting as Support

777
01:08:28,420 --> 01:08:30,579
This is a classic retest pattern

778
01:08:33,039 --> 01:08:36,159
and a great trading opportunity

779
01:08:37,500 --> 01:08:40,239
If you see a Pinbar here

780
01:08:40,560 --> 01:08:44,239
at the old Resistance turned Support

781
01:08:44,239 --> 01:08:46,659
that's a high-probability setup

782
01:08:46,659 --> 01:08:48,979
combining candlestick patterns with Support and Resistance

783
01:08:50,500 --> 01:08:52,939
This is what we call confluence

784
01:08:54,199 --> 01:08:57,699
when multiple signals line up

785
01:08:57,699 --> 01:09:04,840
Alright, so to summarize

786
01:09:04,840 --> 01:09:07,720
Support and Resistance are price zones

787
01:09:07,720 --> 01:09:13,720
not exact lines

788
01:09:14,420 --> 01:09:19,659
They can switch roles when broken

789
01:09:19,659 --> 01:09:24,500
Support becomes Resistance

790
01:09:24,500 --> 01:09:27,020
Resistance becomes Support

791
01:09:27,020 --> 01:09:32,000
The more times a level is tested

792
01:09:33,500 --> 01:09:36,300
the stronger it becomes

793
01:09:36,300 --> 01:09:41,720
We can use them with candlestick patterns

794
01:09:41,720 --> 01:09:45,279
for better trading decisions

795
01:09:45,279 --> 01:09:49,239
Support and Resistance work on all timeframes

796
01:09:49,239 --> 01:09:53,920
from 1-minute charts to monthly charts

797
01:09:53,920 --> 01:09:57,800
The concept is the same

798
01:09:57,800 --> 01:10:02,140
just on different scales

799
01:10:02,140 --> 01:10:05,800
Now, when you're analyzing charts

800
01:10:05,800 --> 01:10:09,260
start with higher timeframes first

801
01:10:09,260 --> 01:10:15,460
like weekly or 4-hour charts

802
01:10:15,899 --> 01:10:20,439
to find the major Support and Resistance zones

803
01:10:21,859 --> 01:10:25,520
Then drill down to lower timeframes

804
01:10:25,520 --> 01:10:29,319
to find your entry points

805
01:10:29,319 --> 01:10:32,920
This top-down approach

806
01:10:32,920 --> 01:10:35,100
gives you better perspective

807
01:10:35,100 --> 01:10:40,640
of the overall market structure

808
01:10:41,739 --> 01:10:44,420
Alright, we've covered a lot today

809
01:10:47,399 --> 01:10:52,939
about Support and Resistance

810
01:10:52,939 --> 01:10:54,220
This is Part 2 of Price Action

811
01:10:56,399 --> 01:11:00,899
In Part 1, we learned about candlesticks

812
01:11:00,899 --> 01:11:06,140
Now in Part 2, we've learned Support and Resistance

813
01:11:07,140 --> 01:11:13,460
These two components together

814
01:11:13,460 --> 01:11:17,960
form the foundation of Price Action trading

815
01:11:17,960 --> 01:11:22,640
When you combine candlestick patterns

816
01:11:22,640 --> 01:11:25,060
with Support and Resistance zones

817
01:11:25,060 --> 01:11:30,439
you'll have a powerful trading system

818
01:11:31,500 --> 01:11:36,560
The key is to practice

819
01:11:36,560 --> 01:11:39,960
looking at many charts

820
01:11:42,039 --> 01:11:45,439
identifying these levels

821
01:11:45,439 --> 01:11:49,979
and watching how price reacts

822
01:11:49,979 --> 01:12:06,539
Over time, you'll develop

823
01:12:06,539 --> 01:12:10,760
an eye for these patterns

824
01:12:10,760 --> 01:12:14,100
and you'll start recognizing them quickly

825
01:12:14,340 --> 01:12:16,920
Remember, Support and Resistance

826
01:12:16,920 --> 01:12:20,319
are the most important tools in Price Action

827
01:12:20,319 --> 01:12:25,699
and when you find these simple patterns, that's it

828
01:12:25,699 --> 01:12:28,560
there's consistent profit opportunity

829
01:12:29,340 --> 01:12:30,579
Thank you very much. Goodbye.
