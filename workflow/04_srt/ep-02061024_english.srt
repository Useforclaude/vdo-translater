00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:04,839
Hello! Let's continue with Part 2 of Candlesticks.

2
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:10,839
We're talking about Momentum Analysis.

3
00:00:10,839 --> 00:00:15,119
In English it's called "Beyond the Basics of Candlestick" which means going beyond

4
00:00:15,119 --> 00:00:18,140
the fundamentals of candlesticks, which is Momentum analysis.

5
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:22,100
Buying and selling pressure, which side is dominating the game.

6
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:24,260
How do we analyze this?

7
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:27,739
We're going to read this together like reading a map,

8
00:00:27,739 --> 00:00:28,960
like navigation,

9
00:00:29,719 --> 00:00:31,140
like if we're going

10
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:33,960
from Bangkok to Chiang Mai, how do we get there?

11
00:00:34,579 --> 00:00:35,759
Is the road good or bad?

12
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:37,340
Turn left or turn right?

13
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:39,479
Or if we want to adjust,

14
00:00:39,479 --> 00:00:40,799
it depends on what you're comfortable with.

15
00:00:40,799 --> 00:00:42,299
If you understand Momentum,

16
00:00:42,299 --> 00:00:44,500
you can turn it into a fairy tale, or a novel,

17
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:46,200
or your own personal story,

18
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:47,439
whatever works for you.

19
00:00:47,439 --> 00:00:53,320
For me, I like to think of it more like an army, like

20
00:00:53,320 --> 00:01:00,939
two cities or two countries at war.

21
00:01:00,939 --> 00:01:06,079
Buyers versus sellers, which side will win, which side has the power to attack,

22
00:01:06,079 --> 00:01:10,180
to advance, who has the better commanding general?

23
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:14,579
Let's dive in. Enough intro, let's get to the content.

24
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:22,299
So with momentum, which one, the buying force,

25
00:01:22,299 --> 00:01:27,700
will the bulls win? Because if we see a candle like this, the bears

26
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:31,299
Bulls mean going up, bears mean going down.

27
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:41,459
And you might wonder why this symbol, why is this bulls and this bears? Let's take a look.

28
00:01:42,960 --> 00:02:01,280
Let's start with momentum analysis. Momentum is like, if we compare it, it's like the swing force, the swing force of power, like when we

29
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:07,159
swing a pendulum. When it swings to this side, the momentum it has

30
00:02:07,159 --> 00:02:11,740
still carries it swinging up until it runs out of force, then swings back to the other side.

31
00:02:12,159 --> 00:02:31,259
That's what we call momentum. When one side starts to weaken,

32
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:33,460
at this point the selling pressure is very strong.

33
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:35,680
Then it gets smaller.

34
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,340
The selling pressure starts decreasing.

35
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:39,639
We already learned about the Body.

36
00:02:39,639 --> 00:02:40,360
Because the Body,

37
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:43,900
between a large Body and a small short Body,

38
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:47,599
which one has more buying or selling pressure?

39
00:02:48,219 --> 00:02:48,780
Therefore,

40
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:52,860
this small candle obviously has less selling pressure than the large candle.

41
00:02:54,719 --> 00:03:00,340
It's just getting smaller, the buying force is gradually decreasing, see?

42
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:03,580
Let me give you another comparison.

43
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:07,520
Compare it to when the price

44
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:13,539
is running in which direction, like

45
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:20,780
like a car, I don't know if you've been in a car,

46
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:50,759
the car is coming at 200 km per hour.

47
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:56,139
You definitely can't catch it at 200 km, it has to go to the intersection ahead.

48
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:59,360
So for you to make a U-turn here,

49
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:03,080
means you were running at 200 km per hour.

50
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:04,240
Right?

51
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:09,199
Running, running, running,

52
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:12,199
you have to brake, right? Slowly,

53
00:04:12,199 --> 00:04:16,000
it will slow down, slow down, and then you wait

54
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:17,300
to make the U-turn.

55
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:24,800
After that you can accelerate again, like that. The chart

56
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:29,220
is the same. These small ones

57
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:32,339
are like when it's slowing down, braking,

58
00:04:32,339 --> 00:04:47,279
that's it. It's gradually slowing down, slowing down, which means if we see this,

59
00:04:47,959 --> 00:04:52,379
there's a chance it might U-turn here.

60
00:04:53,359 --> 00:04:55,699
The other side is the same, it's going down,

61
00:04:55,699 --> 00:04:59,360
coming down strong. Green, small green, red, red.

62
00:04:59,779 --> 00:05:01,339
And there's a tail, see the tail?

63
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,939
It should be red, it should be fully red,

64
00:05:03,939 --> 00:05:06,600
but it got pushed back up like this.

65
00:05:09,259 --> 00:05:15,100
A tail this big shows there's strong buying pressure. When it bounced up, buyers stepped in, might go down but buyers push up.

66
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:19,980
Finally it closes as a full green candle like this.

67
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:24,600
Coming down strong, then the force hit the brakes.

68
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,699
If it's a car starting to brake, it will slow down,

69
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:29,899
there's a chance it can turn around.

70
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:33,819
If we use the battlefield analogy that I'm comfortable with,

71
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:40,600
if you understand and it suits you,

72
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:44,740
like if I see it as a battlefield, the red army keeps attacking,

73
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:48,220
keeps attacking, but later the troops they're sending

74
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:53,600
start to have less power. The green side counterattacks and reclaims territory,

75
00:05:53,600 --> 00:06:00,540
like this. There's a chance it will continue. This is like

76
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:07,620
this goes up up up like this, will it reverse down? If you see a chart like this

77
00:06:07,879 --> 00:06:12,160
and you think it will turn, will you enter a sell? Think it will reverse down?

78
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:15,180
The chance is very low that you can sell here.

79
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:17,240
Because it's like coming strong, coming fast at two hundred,

80
00:06:17,779 --> 00:06:19,279
one hundred eighty, two hundred, around here.

81
00:06:19,659 --> 00:06:22,980
If it's a car, it definitely has to continue. The force is still there.

82
00:06:23,519 --> 00:06:26,040
But then we see the next pattern, running along like this,

83
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:28,399
starting to have some like this, like this, like this,

84
00:06:29,219 --> 00:06:31,319
showing that the car is starting to slow down.

85
00:06:32,239 --> 00:06:35,339
Starting to brake a bit now, but even after braking it's probably still not stopping.

86
00:06:35,339 --> 00:06:40,259
Just seeing this tiny one like this, after braking it probably continues.

87
00:06:40,259 --> 00:06:59,259
It hasn't slowed down to the point where it can reverse. From two hundred maybe down to one sixty.

88
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:01,779
If we see the next candle, there's a chance

89
00:07:01,779 --> 00:07:04,180
it could be red next.

90
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:07,300
You might be able to turn around the chart here, something like this.

91
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:09,639
We're analyzing momentum as a story.

92
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,259
The other side is the same.

93
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:18,339
This one I'll speak quickly, I'll go into more detail

94
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:21,379
later when we read the actual chart.

95
00:07:21,379 --> 00:07:26,220
To make it more fun and easier to understand, here,

96
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:31,060
the car is coming fast, boom boom boom boom boom.

97
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:51,360
Here we have small ones, starting to brake a bit, here's another small one.

98
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:57,560
Will it turn or reverse? But the chance isn't high yet, the chance isn't high.

99
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:04,019
It will be higher when, when this candle changes to the next pattern instead.

100
00:08:04,759 --> 00:08:08,040
Green like this and the next candle isn't red, let's say it is red.

101
00:08:09,219 --> 00:08:21,339
There's a higher chance than with a red candle like this. If the next one looks like this, the chance is even higher.

102
00:08:21,339 --> 00:08:23,500
It looks like it's already slowing down, see? It's reversing now.

103
00:08:24,439 --> 00:08:26,399
The next candle confirms it's definitely reversing.

104
00:08:27,139 --> 00:08:28,800
Like it's made a U-turn and about to go.

105
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:32,679
About to step on the accelerator and continue in the direction it U-turned.

106
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:34,700
This shows this candle has the most power

107
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,220
in terms of momentum reversing.

108
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:45,240
This one comes fast.

109
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:46,799
For this to reverse like this,

110
00:08:46,799 --> 00:08:48,019
it has to reverse like this.

111
00:08:48,019 --> 00:08:50,039
We need to see that the force is decreasing.

112
00:08:50,039 --> 00:08:51,440
The force is decreasing.

113
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,639
This one the force is increasing.

114
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:57,059
But when it increases a lot like this,

115
00:08:57,059 --> 00:08:58,399
it might face resistance.

116
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:03,100
This is momentum.

117
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:06,059
Momentum is loving.

118
00:09:06,539 --> 00:09:08,039
Momentum gradually decreasing.

119
00:09:08,039 --> 00:09:08,700
Slowing down.

120
00:09:09,919 --> 00:09:10,799
There's a chance.

121
00:09:14,019 --> 00:09:20,840
There's another pattern that technically means if you see small candlesticks clustered together like this,

122
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:25,779
and suddenly you see a big candle, a long bar comes out, this is definitely called a big candle.

123
00:09:25,779 --> 00:09:29,299
Because compared to the previous context or the previous candle set, the whole set,

124
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,519
it's clearly, obviously big. The momentum direction surging here

125
00:09:34,519 --> 00:09:39,279
will determine the direction and increase the chance of continuing in this candle's direction.

126
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:43,899
A big candle, suddenly, out of nowhere, a red one drops down this much.

127
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:48,759
This means it won't reverse up anytime soon.

128
00:09:48,759 --> 00:09:53,399
It has to continue. It will pause and then continue like this, see?

129
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:58,179
But on the other hand, if it's been going down for a while,

130
00:09:58,179 --> 00:10:04,039
meaning it's been running for some distance and suddenly boom, a long one comes out bigger than the others,

131
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:12,299
as a pin bar, there's a percentage or chance that it runs out of steam and can reverse.

132
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,100
Need to wait for another confirmation.

133
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:15,600
Like this pattern.

134
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:17,940
If you look at the pattern it becomes a

135
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:19,679
W shape or

136
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,059
double bottom.

137
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:22,220
Then it reverses.

138
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:24,779
In this period, see?

139
00:10:24,779 --> 00:10:27,299
It's red boom, and there's a reversal candle here.

140
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:29,779
And this set here is Engulfing.

141
00:10:29,779 --> 00:10:34,259
Combine this candle set, combine the whole set. This green candle isn't just this one.

142
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:42,419
We learned about combining candlesticks. As I said, we don't need to memorize many patterns.

143
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:46,340
If we combine them, we can analyze everything.

144
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:54,840
Take this whole set and combine it all together. In the end you'll get a green candle like this.

145
00:10:58,639 --> 00:11:05,759
See? A pin bar. Does it mean strong buying pressure? Yes. So it goes up.

146
00:11:05,759 --> 00:11:10,539
If you combine this set,

147
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:18,399
we covered this in the previous part, combining candlesticks. Cut off the top,

148
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:21,460
it'll be just a tiny bit of green body, the rest is all tail.

149
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:30,879
And the green top here indicates strong buying pressure already.

150
00:11:30,879 --> 00:11:35,120
This candle confirms going up based on combining the candlesticks.

151
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:42,559
Same here, coming down, slowing down, finding a candle with a tail showing resistance from the other side.

152
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:48,019
This means there's a chance it will go up

153
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:54,179
in the direction of the resistance. Need to see the next candle confirm again.

154
00:11:56,180 --> 00:12:04,399
And another rule we should remember precisely is to wait for the candlestick time to finish or close before acting.

155
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:09,460
If it's a 15-minute candle, that candle must complete the full 15 minutes until it closes with a clear pattern.

156
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:13,320
A daily candle must finish the day, a 1-hour candle must finish the hour.

157
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:15,620
Because otherwise it might be a case like this:

158
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:20,200
Small small, then suddenly a big red one shoots out like this,

159
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:26,100
you sell following it, thinking it will go down because

160
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:31,279
with this much selling pressure it will definitely go down. But let's say this candle is a 1-hour candle.

161
00:12:31,759 --> 00:12:40,019
It drops this much, runs down, and stays down like this continuously until about 59 minutes, 59 minutes.

162
00:12:40,019 --> 00:12:45,720
One more minute to complete the hour, it suddenly shoots up and closes like this. After one hour it becomes this candle.

163
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:54,200
This is actually buying pressure. Just one minute and it becomes buying pressure instead.

164
00:12:56,340 --> 00:13:00,899
Selling here, you could get stopped out. It might go up like this.

165
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:04,799
Because here, see analyzing momentum here, what is this?

166
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:10,700
The forces are evenly matched. We still don't know who wins or loses. They're completely equal.

167
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:17,620
Then suddenly it shoots up like this, deciding the entire period

168
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:23,000
that buying pressure has a chance to win, so there's a chance it will go up like this.

169
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:29,360
Same here, boom boom boom, selling following, making

170
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:35,279
if it breaks the previous high or resistance level, boom following drops

171
00:13:37,319 --> 00:13:40,460
because momentum is decreasing so there's a chance it goes down.

172
00:13:42,039 --> 00:13:45,320
Buy would definitely get stuck, so wait,

173
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:48,480
wait for the candle to finish its time first.

174
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:51,440
Same thing, another case.

175
00:13:53,419 --> 00:13:57,980
Downtrend breaks support, strong selling.

176
00:13:58,439 --> 00:14:00,899
Sell following, breaks out of the channel.

177
00:14:00,899 --> 00:14:03,220
Breaks the trendline, comes down to support trendline.

178
00:14:03,779 --> 00:14:08,200
Selling before time ends, it shoots up as buying pressure.

179
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:13,120
Sold here, candle closes like this.

180
00:14:13,499 --> 00:14:16,659
There's a chance it will go the opposite direction from where we

181
00:14:16,659 --> 00:14:20,559
sold our order. So wait for the candle to close first, wait for it to close,

182
00:14:20,559 --> 00:14:23,659
determine what kind of candle it actually is.

183
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:28,580
Like this we come to read

184
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:31,259
momentum, the force of action.

185
00:14:31,819 --> 00:14:34,379
So if we encounter a candlestick shape like this,

186
00:14:34,379 --> 00:14:36,659
will it go up or continue down?

187
00:14:37,239 --> 00:14:37,639
Well,

188
00:14:38,899 --> 00:14:40,899
we'd analyze it will probably go up

189
00:14:40,899 --> 00:14:42,100
because this candle is big,

190
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:44,039
small, showing

191
00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:47,960
the original force that was running from before is decreasing,

192
00:14:48,539 --> 00:14:50,299
and the other side can

193
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:54,919
engulf all of it, see? Engulfs all of this candle.

194
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:00,879
The buying side has stronger power suddenly in this period. If it's a pattern they call it

195
00:15:00,879 --> 00:15:04,279
a candlestick pattern they call engulfing, swallowing.

196
00:15:04,279 --> 00:15:06,860
Swallows this entire candle, showing the buying side has strong power.

197
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:11,000
There's a chance the next candle if it's green will go up green.

198
00:15:21,699 --> 00:15:26,700
Compared to this one which has a much higher chance of going down for sure.

199
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:33,639
Because it won even though this standing candle has force, but came down but didn't close it all,

200
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:37,779
didn't beat the opening price of this candle yet.

201
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:51,419
But this one has 3 candles, one red candle eats them all, engulfs everything. So massive selling pressure here beats

202
00:15:52,000 --> 00:16:00,000
all 3 of these buying forces completely. This one might have a little fight left, need to see the next candle if it can fight back.

203
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:06,840
Now what we see like this, 1 candle, candle A and B, exactly the same.

204
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:09,220
Let's say it's a 1-hour candle, make it 1 hour.

205
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:19,460
When we see this, do we think it will go up or down? Is this candle strong?

206
00:16:20,879 --> 00:16:23,740
Seeing it like this, we should think it's already strong, lots of buying pressure.

207
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:26,259
But if we break it down to a smaller timeframe,

208
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:30,600
like a 15-minute timeframe.

209
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:33,580
How many 15-minute candles make up one hour?

210
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:34,879
Which becomes one 1-hour candle,

211
00:16:34,879 --> 00:16:36,200
there must be 4 candles, right?

212
00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:38,480
Now when we break it down,

213
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:41,679
this candle is composed of these 4 candles.

214
00:16:43,179 --> 00:16:45,220
1, 2, 3, 4 candles, 15 minutes each.

215
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:49,279
Does this quite confirm it's an uptrend?

216
00:16:49,719 --> 00:16:50,639
Uptrend.

217
00:16:55,159 --> 00:16:58,360
But the exact same candle broken down to 15 minutes looks like this:

218
00:16:58,360 --> 00:16:59,820
15-minute candle number 1,

219
00:17:00,239 --> 00:17:02,259
15-minute candle number 2 going up,

220
00:17:02,259 --> 00:17:04,119
then sellers attack and push it down.

221
00:17:04,119 --> 00:17:05,440
This one buyers push back up,

222
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:06,960
and it becomes a candle like this.

223
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:09,259
This shows which one is stronger between A and B?

224
00:17:10,039 --> 00:17:12,799
It must be A that has more power. Wow,

225
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:15,079
this is all buying, it goes up steadily.

226
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:16,740
Has more power.

227
00:17:17,539 --> 00:17:19,640
The next candle has a chance to be green

228
00:17:20,159 --> 00:17:21,480
and continue up. This one might

229
00:17:22,279 --> 00:17:23,880
be green but then turn red,

230
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:25,559
oscillating again the next hour.

231
00:17:26,099 --> 00:17:28,420
Because it's chaotic like this, see?

232
00:17:30,419 --> 00:17:33,680
The momentum or its force isn't as consistent as this one.

233
00:17:36,359 --> 00:17:40,079
Should understand in comparing candle to candle that look similar.

234
00:17:40,259 --> 00:17:42,660
When we break down to see the finer details, the smaller parts,

235
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:48,019
we'll see clearly whether the candle we're looking at is composed strongly or not strongly.

236
00:17:49,639 --> 00:17:54,480
Next like this, reading the trend as an uptrend, going up continuously.

237
00:17:54,480 --> 00:18:12,640
Finding a long tail this big near the top, does it show selling pressure?

238
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:14,460
See? Small small small.

239
00:18:15,759 --> 00:18:17,839
Shows the energy is starting to weaken.

240
00:18:18,879 --> 00:18:22,039
When it's weak and selling pressure hits, this shows very strong selling pressure.

241
00:18:23,279 --> 00:18:24,700
There's a chance it will go down.

242
00:18:26,079 --> 00:18:26,579
Will it go down?

243
00:18:27,479 --> 00:18:33,579
Here, this point tells you, Westerners call it a thank you.

244
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:37,440
Thank you in advance, finding a tail this big going in,

245
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:41,339
and the next candle finds a big red.

246
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:45,579
This is called a big candle, see? Compared to the previous candles, this is definitely big.

247
00:18:45,899 --> 00:18:49,539
Remember what I said? I already mentioned

248
00:18:49,999 --> 00:18:54,039
if it's in a small frame and suddenly boom like this,

249
00:18:54,039 --> 00:18:56,119
one candle, a big candle appears,

250
00:18:56,619 --> 00:19:00,859
the direction it will go next usually goes in the same direction as this candle.

251
00:19:01,059 --> 00:19:05,220
This candle is red, showing selling pressure, so there's a chance it will go like this.

252
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:09,900
It comes down and then pauses, accumulates energy a bit, then continues, continues down, see?

253
00:19:13,339 --> 00:19:18,940
This is another case, coming down as a downtrend. Earlier was, earlier it was an uptrend.

254
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:22,940
This one comes from a downtrend and suddenly finds this candle shooting up.

255
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:28,799
Does it show buying pressure? Buying pressure. Count it, how many candles?

256
00:19:30,159 --> 00:19:33,319
This one candle eats them all, eats them all, see?

257
00:19:34,619 --> 00:19:40,019
The territory drawn from top to bottom eats everything. So it's considered very strong buying.

258
00:19:40,359 --> 00:19:42,480
However these selling pressures pushed down, don't know,

259
00:19:43,099 --> 00:19:44,680
suddenly bought everything all at once,

260
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:45,319
all of this.

261
00:19:45,659 --> 00:19:48,619
So it meets the same criteria as before.

262
00:19:50,139 --> 00:19:51,140
Small small small,

263
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:53,259
clustered together then suddenly boom a candle like this.

264
00:19:53,659 --> 00:19:54,680
Clustered like this,

265
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:56,799
small small then boom a candle this size.

266
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:58,039
This is called a big candle for sure.

267
00:19:58,039 --> 00:20:03,880
Even though we see here it's already big, already big. Compared to others, here it's big, compared to these,

268
00:20:04,399 --> 00:20:11,799
this one's big, this green is big, this red is big. If compared to this set, this red is considered big, lots of selling.

269
00:20:12,199 --> 00:20:16,039
But this green candle beats them all, definitely considered big.

270
00:20:16,039 --> 00:20:24,539
Quite clearly bigger, so the momentum direction will lead in the same direction as this candle,

271
00:20:24,879 --> 00:20:28,200
which is uptrend like this, see?

272
00:20:30,239 --> 00:20:32,140
Now it goes up, same thing.

273
00:20:32,879 --> 00:20:34,839
It goes up, see? It goes up.

274
00:20:35,779 --> 00:20:38,299
Is there starting to be a fight back from the selling side?

275
00:20:39,179 --> 00:20:43,359
Starting to have it. Candles start getting shorter, green starts getting shorter, shorter.

276
00:20:43,819 --> 00:20:44,799
Boom, then long.

277
00:20:47,099 --> 00:20:50,220
And no more green, how many candles? 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

278
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:55,279
See? Then there's, there's green, but the green is just these tiny 3.

279
00:20:55,279 --> 00:20:58,319
Shows loss of momentum energy already.

280
00:20:59,059 --> 00:21:03,259
So the selling side is starting to have power coming back.

281
00:21:03,599 --> 00:21:06,839
If you still remember, this is the top, see?

282
00:21:06,839 --> 00:21:09,839
Combine the candles, these 2 candles, green and red, what candle do you get?

283
00:21:10,319 --> 00:21:14,859
You'll definitely get a pin bar. This candle.

284
00:21:23,279 --> 00:21:31,680
This pair combined, see? Cut off this top, boom, opening price take the opening

285
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:44,839
price of candle 1, closing price of candle 2, becomes the body, right?

286
00:21:44,839 --> 00:21:58,900
Yes, the wick is on top, you get the head, clear pin bar

287
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:02,700
right here. So there's a chance it will go down, see? Will it go down?

288
00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:08,519
Goes down, see? The benefit of us not having to memorize patterns.

289
00:22:08,519 --> 00:22:13,380
We analyze as momentum, as energy going up, then use

290
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:15,940
the principle of combining candlesticks together

291
00:22:16,519 --> 00:22:19,119
to find buying or selling pressure, which side it's clear on,

292
00:22:19,459 --> 00:22:21,880
to help in decision making or analysis.

293
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:23,619
It becomes much clearer

294
00:22:23,779 --> 00:22:25,380
than memorizing patterns like

295
00:22:26,179 --> 00:22:28,720
this is a pin bar, it doesn't go down.

296
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:30,700
Well it doesn't go down.

297
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:31,880
You should analyze.

298
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:34,160
Analyze as momentum, as force going up.

299
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:39,380
And at this high point it's still continuing up, haven't found selling pressure pushing back yet.

300
00:22:39,759 --> 00:22:44,380
Just found it now, pushing back, and here selling pressure trying to push back up.

301
00:22:44,719 --> 00:22:48,059
But in the end does buying pressure push up? Pushes up, until only this much head is left.

302
00:22:49,699 --> 00:22:53,940
And the next candle? Still goes up more. This is considered still fighting.

303
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:56,319
Coming to look, there's a tail. There's a tail, fighting each other continuously.

304
00:22:57,379 --> 00:22:59,740
Until it becomes clear, at this point where it's starting to slow down.

305
00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:00,880
This point is clearer.

306
00:23:03,119 --> 00:23:06,160
This period is very clear that they're fighting quite a lot.

307
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:09,700
If we see this, we wait and watch.

308
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:13,519
Don't enter an order. Wait to see which side will win for sure.

309
00:23:13,859 --> 00:23:15,980
Until we can decide, we find this pair.

310
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:21,519
Combined, it becomes a pin bar, and the next set is a candle that doesn't

311
00:23:21,519 --> 00:23:25,200
have much force. When it doesn't have much force, there's a chance that

312
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:32,240
it won't go up much. So it came down like this.

313
00:23:36,380 --> 00:23:37,359
Another one, this one.

314
00:23:38,859 --> 00:23:49,059
Remember the case where it's small small small then finds a long candle?

315
00:23:50,099 --> 00:23:57,960
Momentum says it will continue in the direction of the long candle. Another case, going up or down continuously,

316
00:24:00,919 --> 00:24:10,539
and suddenly a big candle appears, there's a chance it could reverse back.

317
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:16,740
Because this is considered a strong candle, strong. This candle fights back.

318
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:21,559
Selling fights back. Can you combine this candle? If you combine carefully, you'll see

319
00:24:21,559 --> 00:24:25,500
these two candles first, combined, it becomes another one, see?

320
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:30,099
This becomes the tail, the wick. Opening price is here of candle one.

321
00:24:30,099 --> 00:24:33,660
Keep it. Closing price of candle two is here, becomes here.

322
00:24:34,139 --> 00:24:37,039
If you combine three candles, this candle comes in too,

323
00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:40,859
take the closing price of this candle, you'll barely have any green body left.

324
00:24:42,359 --> 00:24:45,960
The rest is all tail, all wick. So there's a chance it will go down like this.

325
00:24:47,619 --> 00:24:53,460
See? Next one, same same one.

326
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:58,119
This goes down long. Lots of selling pressure? Lots. Very much.

327
00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:05,619
And it continues down as a set. But notice, see the body gets shorter?

328
00:25:06,899 --> 00:25:13,059
Shows selling pressure, momentum gradually decreasing. The swing force of price gradually lessening.

329
00:25:13,319 --> 00:25:18,740
Simply put, this might have turned around already, stepped on the accelerator

330
00:25:21,759 --> 00:25:26,099
going up over 100 km/h very fast, then became 200 in this direction,

331
00:25:26,099 --> 00:25:31,339
like this. But after driving for a while they start releasing the accelerator, start braking, slowing, slowing down.

332
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:36,559
And green comes back, see? When it was long, it still didn't have, we didn't see any green at all.

333
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:41,400
When it finds green starting to appear, shows buying pressure is starting to return, starting to fight, starting to fight back.

334
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:49,920
Can it fight back? Well, looking at this pattern fighting back is quite difficult because it's small small small small small.

335
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:55,480
This one comes this big, these ones are small small, can it fight back? It's not big. Can't, so it goes down like this.

336
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:58,019
From here, finally goes down.

337
00:25:59,659 --> 00:26:01,480
So

338
00:26:04,439 --> 00:26:06,920
let's look at real charts better. Got the momentum thing.

339
00:26:07,139 --> 00:26:10,680
More fun if we analyze it as a story.

340
00:26:12,899 --> 00:26:15,839
As a story means I'll assume like this.

341
00:26:18,059 --> 00:26:18,839
Don't take it too

342
00:26:18,839 --> 00:26:21,559
give me a bit more.

343
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:28,519
About this much so we understand, same page.

344
00:26:28,519 --> 00:26:30,500
When I analyze momentum,

345
00:26:31,699 --> 00:26:37,339
I analyze it like there are two cities.

346
00:26:39,439 --> 00:26:41,740
Draw it like, not really cities, consider it countries.

347
00:26:41,740 --> 00:26:46,039
I'm in ancient war times, with generals riding horses and stuff,

348
00:26:46,039 --> 00:26:48,500
fighting each other, wielding swords, there are bows.

349
00:26:49,620 --> 00:27:06,279
This one is the red city side, another one, this changes to green city.

350
00:27:08,559 --> 00:27:13,480
Like this. Assume like this when I speak and explain so we understand the same way.

351
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:25,099
I'll compare that it's generals, it's armies. In this candle there will be, what was it,

352
00:27:28,739 --> 00:27:33,140
soldiers, like people figures like this.

353
00:27:35,399 --> 00:27:35,700
Many.

354
00:27:36,319 --> 00:27:39,500
Let me explain first, as armies.

355
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:45,900
Assume it's an army, as people, many many many, armor 1,000 people like this.

356
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:49,460
Yeah, an army of 1,000 people. This is 1,000 people, see?

357
00:27:50,419 --> 00:27:54,680
When it's smaller, shows this group might be only 3,000 people.

358
00:27:56,039 --> 00:27:59,279
2,000 people, not that few.

359
00:28:02,539 --> 00:28:05,299
Can't arrange them yet, rough count just for today first.

360
00:28:06,099 --> 00:28:08,259
But this one is only 1,000 people, 500 people.

361
00:28:08,779 --> 00:28:12,440
Think, can 500 people fight 10,000 people?

362
00:28:13,019 --> 00:28:15,140
I think you can't fight already.

363
00:28:15,140 --> 00:28:21,420
The army on that side sends in, front army, definitely die if sent into that territory.

364
00:28:23,099 --> 00:28:24,619
Let's use an object to understand the middle like this first.

365
00:28:24,619 --> 00:28:25,859
Like this, it's the dividing line.

366
00:28:26,379 --> 00:28:28,680
This side wants to seize this side.

367
00:28:29,259 --> 00:28:30,519
This side wants to seize this side.

368
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:32,640
When they want to seize, they do like this.

369
00:28:33,419 --> 00:28:35,500
This side wants to seize this side, they have to try how?

370
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:37,339
Inch forward into this side's territory, right?

371
00:28:38,179 --> 00:28:39,420
Inch in, inch in.

372
00:28:39,619 --> 00:28:41,019
It goes up up continuously like this.

373
00:28:41,199 --> 00:28:42,839
It's an uptrend.

374
00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:44,920
Eating this territory.

375
00:29:07,659 --> 00:29:11,039
Is there fighting back or not? To seize their own territory back?

376
00:29:12,639 --> 00:29:17,220
And can they inch into this side's territory, get some back?

377
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:23,079
When I read candlesticks, read momentum, I turn it into a story and it's fun, not stressful.

378
00:29:23,839 --> 00:29:28,079
Actually entering orders when trading is stressful, have to use your mind, it's somewhat stressful.

379
00:29:28,079 --> 00:29:47,200
But if we assume something like this, it becomes readable continuously, entertaining, relaxing.

380
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:51,539
Overall combined it becomes clearer. Let's look at examples from real charts a bit.

381
00:29:53,799 --> 00:29:54,720
Assume that

382
00:30:00,039 --> 00:30:02,599
let's try looking at this pair, GA.

383
00:30:04,199 --> 00:30:05,859
1-hour chart.

384
00:30:07,079 --> 00:30:09,660
Really which chart you're comfortable with, you play that chart.

385
00:30:11,879 --> 00:30:14,880
We can already see this. Won't use this, let me start like here.

386
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:15,460
Assume,

387
00:30:15,460 --> 00:30:23,079
assume we see like this, going down, then going up, zigzag zigzag zigzag zigzag.

388
00:30:23,079 --> 00:30:29,420
Shows this is an uptrend right? Going up, going up then it goes zigzag zigzag,

389
00:30:29,420 --> 00:30:33,420
sideways like this. No, not going up directly. If we read this,

390
00:30:33,420 --> 00:30:40,240
what does it mean? Shows starting to have loss of power or power of the uptrend side, the buying side

391
00:30:41,439 --> 00:30:46,380
starting to decrease. If it's armies, troops, sending people up to attack,

392
00:30:46,699 --> 00:30:50,600
but can only attack this far, attack up to take territory, this side's territory, only this much.

393
00:30:50,599 --> 00:30:53,200
Seize territory only this much then fighting, struggling like this.

394
00:30:54,619 --> 00:30:57,180
Do you think next it will go up or go down?

395
00:30:57,579 --> 00:30:58,440
Will they win?

396
00:30:59,719 --> 00:31:04,339
If it's me looking, analyzing momentum, I think

397
00:31:05,679 --> 00:31:11,000
the buying side probably won't win yet. Need to see, need to follow what we learned, candle by candle.

398
00:31:11,899 --> 00:31:17,640
Like this candle, big red, compared to before, this is considered big.

399
00:31:18,059 --> 00:31:23,059
Shows the territory of the selling side, assume they control this area,

400
00:31:23,059 --> 00:31:26,759
this one is the buying people's side, buying city, this is selling city.

401
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:30,920
Sending troops back, like a commanding general, a large army.

402
00:31:31,119 --> 00:31:36,460
Bigger than the small troops fighting, has strong power, already attacking up.

403
00:31:37,299 --> 00:31:47,599
This is the buying city side or green city, it fights back up, still struggling.

404
00:31:49,339 --> 00:31:55,619
Finally pushes up this much, shows they're considered evenly matched in power.

405
00:31:56,319 --> 00:32:01,059
Coming up this much, what will the next candle be? Let's see.

406
00:32:01,879 --> 00:32:06,059
If the next candle is like this, at first I thought seeing this candle it would continue up more.

407
00:32:07,139 --> 00:32:11,359
But it turned out to be only this candle left, see? From big, only this much left.

408
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:18,619
Shows the buying side is starting to weaken. They invaded into their own territory this much.

409
00:32:18,619 --> 00:32:24,299
This one sends troops to push back, but can only push this much, can't push further, stuck.

410
00:32:24,299 --> 00:32:29,619
Stuck in this zone area, stuck at the resistance area, evenly matched.

411
00:32:30,479 --> 00:32:33,819
I guess buying, no selling pressure, the red side

412
00:32:33,819 --> 00:32:48,599
is quite a lot. Selling pressure can push up, true.

413
00:32:49,619 --> 00:32:49,940
Here,

414
00:32:52,439 --> 00:32:52,940
right here,

415
00:32:52,940 --> 00:32:54,119
can't decide anything yet.

416
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:56,039
I still wouldn't dare enter an order.

417
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:58,339
But when finding this candle,

418
00:32:58,339 --> 00:32:59,859
if reading momentum, boom,

419
00:33:00,299 --> 00:33:01,039
see?

420
00:33:01,879 --> 00:33:05,000
However many troops the green sends to fight, more green than red,

421
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:06,400
but it's still not big,

422
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:07,559
not clearly outstanding.

423
00:33:08,439 --> 00:33:09,960
Red breaks through to here,

424
00:33:10,439 --> 00:33:15,660
sends a large army sweeping everything, controlling all of this, see? So

425
00:33:17,759 --> 00:33:23,160
the next one has a chance that the army, the selling side or red side,

426
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:30,640
will seize the green side's territory in this zone quite a lot, more than before. At first didn't look like much, they're evenly matched.

427
00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:34,660
Finding this going in, you look at this whole set, don't need to just look at this, see?

428
00:33:35,439 --> 00:33:38,740
There's no red candle or green candle as big as this candle.

429
00:33:38,740 --> 00:33:42,619
Shows the army eats them all, counterattacks, the troops sent all die.

430
00:33:43,159 --> 00:33:47,039
Then attacks into the territory, can they attack in? I think they can.

431
00:33:47,039 --> 00:33:51,299
See? Here it comes.

432
00:33:54,099 --> 00:34:01,539
Once it comes, inching in, if this one finds this candle confirming, here I wouldn't dare sell, but if we're trading, if we read only momentum

433
00:34:01,539 --> 00:34:10,179
of the candlestick pattern, closing this candle, next candle can risk selling. Since momentum,

434
00:34:10,179 --> 00:34:10,980
the chance has come.

435
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:15,360
For the green to fight back, seize territory back until going up like this,

436
00:34:15,980 --> 00:34:18,539
low chance. Because we've read the momentum.

437
00:34:18,539 --> 00:34:21,420
We read it as a story like this, as momentum of the price action,

438
00:34:21,420 --> 00:34:24,039
we didn't just wait to see the chart pattern

439
00:34:25,380 --> 00:34:29,039
whether it will go up or, uh, like having to memorize this pattern, up down.

440
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:33,360
But if it's momentum as a story, finding this candle boom, one candle, we know

441
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:39,380
the selling side has more power, sending troops to attack,

442
00:34:39,380 --> 00:34:40,860
killing this side completely.

443
00:34:42,220 --> 00:34:44,599
Then inch into this side's territory already, see?

444
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:47,000
Inch in, got the candle, evenly matched.

445
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:51,199
Big army or not don't know, not a royal army, probably about this much,

446
00:34:51,199 --> 00:34:52,260
but it's a large army

447
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:53,920
coming in this much.

448
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:59,940
Now will look at the other side, can they fight? Need to see the next candle.

449
00:35:00,580 --> 00:35:06,519
Yeah, starting to have counterattack up, see? It's entered the red territory.

450
00:35:06,519 --> 00:35:11,639
This is the red territory of this side. Fighting back, sending troops fighting back as a fighting

451
00:35:11,639 --> 00:35:16,460
candle, evenly matched but not winning yet, see? But if you combine the candles you'll see

452
00:35:16,460 --> 00:35:22,960
it's, well, next chapter we'll tell you

453
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:27,679
because pin bar isn't that wherever a pin bar forms, it will always work there.

454
00:35:28,519 --> 00:35:35,500
There will be points or zones where pin bar has more power than usual,

455
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:37,000
where it rarely fails.

456
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:40,440
Here it's in the middle area. Even though it's a pin bar,

457
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:43,079
but still not certain it will prevail.

458
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:48,139
We just know there are buyers, buying pressure, it's fighting back, that's all.

459
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:54,219
Can they fight? Can't fight. Like this I call can't fight. Why?

460
00:35:55,700 --> 00:35:58,840
Because green came together already. If they can fight, the next candle must be green, must continue green.

461
00:35:59,620 --> 00:36:02,719
Lots of green too, must continue green. But it became red.

462
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:05,219
As the troops of this side that survived,

463
00:36:05,780 --> 00:36:07,340
sending troops to fight this much,

464
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:10,539
taking territory up. But finally the green army

465
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:13,780
dies. Red is the surviving side, the winner.

466
00:36:14,220 --> 00:36:16,320
And there's fighting going on, see the candle wicks?

467
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:22,320
Trying to stretch up then gets pushed, trying to stretch down then gets pushed up.

468
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:24,480
But in the end, red survives, see?

469
00:36:25,059 --> 00:36:29,420
So there's a chance, need to watch next if momentum will decrease more.

470
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:33,019
Here, because finding this one, red survived.

471
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:36,800
Green tries to send remaining troops to fight up more,

472
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,380
still haven't passed the original point, not going much further.

473
00:36:40,380 --> 00:36:43,199
Inching back to get territory, can't get much territory back.

474
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:49,420
After being eaten away from here, 2 candles, only got back this much then got pushed back this much.

475
00:36:49,420 --> 00:36:54,659
Shows I think it's probably losing power already.

476
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:58,780
So the red side probably has more power.

477
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:02,500
Likely has a chance to continue down.

478
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:06,039
Combined with if we've learned that

479
00:37:08,180 --> 00:37:11,719
see? It's small small, then finds a big candle boom coming out this much.

480
00:37:11,719 --> 00:37:15,280
Has momentum to push in the direction of this candle, remember?

481
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:17,320
This is one we keep aside.

482
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:19,900
As consideration data, as data.

483
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:25,420
The rest, considering momentum further, feel that green still probably can't fight.

484
00:37:26,060 --> 00:37:28,000
Price probably has more chance to go down.

485
00:37:36,460 --> 00:37:43,480
Ask why must get to around here, about this much, around support level, around, level, right,

486
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:50,079
level of the city. Look further, see? If finding this candle boom, quite quite

487
00:37:50,079 --> 00:37:57,500
quite confident that the red side, troop power higher than green side already.

488
00:37:57,500 --> 00:38:00,659
Because so far, after attacking in,

489
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:05,679
only sent one army. Came to fight, and couldn't fight at all, no more green coming, see?

490
00:38:06,579 --> 00:38:09,940
Red inches, inches, inches in continuously. Deep in already.

491
00:38:11,220 --> 00:38:12,460
Has a chance to go down more.

492
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:15,639
And this is the result.

493
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:19,219
Reached, red inches up to here.

494
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:21,940
But this candle says what?

495
00:38:24,519 --> 00:38:29,679
This much says the buying side doesn't give up either.

496
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:34,820
Shoots up 10,000, now pushes back, until only this much head left, only this much.

497
00:38:34,820 --> 00:38:38,260
Comes back to the original area, this candle could attack up to only this much,

498
00:38:38,860 --> 00:38:51,920
then sends army attacking in until almost seizing

499
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:55,940
where they set up camp or set up army waiting here.

500
00:38:55,940 --> 00:38:59,699
Has considerable power to not let it go down yet.

501
00:38:59,699 --> 00:39:01,059
So finding this candle, boom,

502
00:39:01,059 --> 00:39:03,639
might have a chance to bounce up, could come up.

503
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:05,900
But will it go higher than this?

504
00:39:07,140 --> 00:39:08,059
Think probably not.

505
00:39:08,059 --> 00:39:09,960
Because this candle is blocking.

506
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:12,099
Need to see further. Need to see further.

507
00:39:12,380 --> 00:39:19,059
Just this candle can't decide yet, just know around here it's dense. Let's see further.

508
00:39:20,820 --> 00:39:25,280
When finding the next candle it says, normally if finding this candle, if green follows,

509
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:30,300
from a candle like this shows strong buying pressure for sure. But this shows selling pressure still won't stop.

510
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:33,340
Still continuing, still will seize territory back.

511
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:37,880
But starting to get smaller already, see?

512
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:40,380
This is big, big.

513
00:39:40,380 --> 00:39:42,320
This one, this candle is considered a big candle.

514
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:44,099
But it only fought back this much.

515
00:39:44,620 --> 00:39:47,539
So when it was pushed back,

516
00:39:47,539 --> 00:39:48,860
and it bounced red back,

517
00:39:48,860 --> 00:39:49,920
shows it inches back,

518
00:39:50,460 --> 00:39:52,539
will win. But finally gets smaller.

519
00:39:52,539 --> 00:39:57,039
Gets smaller, shows the loss of, well, the troops are starting to run out of energy too.

520
00:39:57,039 --> 00:40:00,639
After inching up then getting hit back, and sending more troops again,

521
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:06,179
but troops are starting to weaken, tired, losing energy. There's a chance, there's a chance.

522
00:40:06,179 --> 00:40:08,559
If the next candle is still small, there's a chance it can bounce back up

523
00:40:08,559 --> 00:40:14,760
a bit. Please find that it came down, it might have a rebound going back up, some.

524
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:19,920
Let's see if it will be like that. Here, see? It's getting smaller.

525
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:26,760
Shows red is running out of power, decreasing, decreasing. Green seeing the opportunity just takes back.

526
00:40:27,660 --> 00:40:33,000
See? Takes takes. This one controls the whole candle, sends troops to take.

527
00:40:34,180 --> 00:40:37,480
The area we saw here lots already that it has pushing force up, see?

528
00:40:37,740 --> 00:40:40,800
Shows this area has lots of troops waiting already, the green side waiting.

529
00:40:42,740 --> 00:40:47,679
They won't give up easily, let seize any area. When coming down to here still takes up,

530
00:40:47,679 --> 00:40:53,619
up up. But then starting to lose energy too.

531
00:40:53,619 --> 00:40:56,579
This is green's. Still can't take much back.

532
00:40:57,240 --> 00:41:00,139
Need to see if red will have force to serve again.

533
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:02,980
Look here.

534
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:07,300
See? Green starting to take from here, see?

535
00:41:07,300 --> 00:41:09,840
Take back. When red tries to take back down,

536
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:12,199
it gets pushed back up by green about half.

537
00:41:14,820 --> 00:41:17,920
This is considered evenly matched this period, fighting each other.

538
00:41:21,039 --> 00:41:27,039
Very evenly matched, both small, but green seems to have more troops left but evenly matched.

539
00:41:29,380 --> 00:41:31,860
Here don't need to pay attention, the real price is running.

540
00:41:37,460 --> 00:41:41,539
Now let's see further.

541
00:41:42,780 --> 00:41:46,539
Green is coming, see? Starting to come.

542
00:41:50,860 --> 00:41:51,639
Will it win?

543
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:59,079
If seeing like this shows green is coming, red starting to not appear, not a single red candle, see?

544
00:42:00,019 --> 00:42:03,400
Not appearing at all, there's a chance the next candle will go up more.

545
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:07,519
Then it goes up, really goes up, okay.

546
00:42:09,660 --> 00:42:10,500
This candle says

547
00:42:11,539 --> 00:42:15,300
about defeated the army sent, have little troops left, survivors.

548
00:42:16,060 --> 00:42:18,659
But finally counterattacked back. Sent army reinforcement.

549
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:22,900
This territory is still tough, still won't let in easily. Hit back up.

550
00:42:26,100 --> 00:42:30,840
Defeated the army. But hit back up. Red that attacked in from here, see?

551
00:42:31,240 --> 00:42:32,760
They've been fighting here, this zone.

552
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:38,880
And take back, these two candles, two large armies, this army still controls.

553
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:42,260
This red candle still controls, see? Green still can't beat it.

554
00:42:42,260 --> 00:42:43,780
Still can't win this candle.

555
00:42:44,579 --> 00:42:47,900
Then find the next candle from green, instead of continuing green it becomes red.

556
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:53,719
Shows the red side still has plenty of power left too.

557
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:57,039
So can't take back half of the green candle.

558
00:42:57,039 --> 00:43:02,500
Shows there's a chance to continue down. Because originally it was a downtrend already.

559
00:43:02,500 --> 00:43:07,639
There's a chance they can still inch back. And this is it.

560
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:14,340
This is inching. If taking this much, we've been watching this much, see?

561
00:43:15,640 --> 00:43:18,219
Took back. Finally can seize territory?

562
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:21,460
Almost seized, coming down, lower than the original that was seized.

563
00:43:21,460 --> 00:43:24,659
Meaning entered territory more already. This candle, look at this candle.

564
00:43:25,380 --> 00:43:29,380
It retreats up this much, shows green can fight back quite a bit.

565
00:43:29,720 --> 00:43:33,360
But when finding this candle, big candle, same, even bigger.

566
00:43:36,180 --> 00:43:40,440
Only hit back this much, short, could hit back almost all but only hit back this much.

567
00:43:41,240 --> 00:43:44,880
Shows this side still has more force.

568
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:48,679
So quite able to take territory around here.

569
00:43:49,220 --> 00:43:51,239
Let's zoom out and look from far.

570
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:55,260
Some level, I think can take around here.

571
00:43:55,260 --> 00:43:58,960
Take until reaching here, move down.

572
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:05,980
See? Finally they took this territory already, can help each other go.

573
00:44:05,980 --> 00:44:10,699
Could fight back, finally can't fight back. Came fully.

574
00:44:12,920 --> 00:44:15,539
But still in their city, they'll fight back a bit.

575
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:22,380
When I put it, I'd say can't fight, it must come to here for sure, look from far.

576
00:44:22,380 --> 00:44:27,260
Then take down, take territory down more, hit back about this much.

577
00:44:29,940 --> 00:44:37,619
Is it enough? Can fight? Finally can't fight, breaks through, hits the city.

578
00:44:38,680 --> 00:44:44,639
Finding this candle, can fight? Probably can't.

579
00:44:45,519 --> 00:44:46,380
Depends on the teachers, can fight.

580
00:44:46,380 --> 00:44:49,679
Probably can't. Red takes territory now, at first could only fight this much.

581
00:44:50,260 --> 00:44:53,800
Takes territory, takes territory. This zone taken already, comes to take this zone more.

582
00:44:54,340 --> 00:44:59,059
Then finds these 2 candles, sends army in, shows sent 2 large armies.

583
00:44:59,059 --> 00:45:02,079
Green can only fight this much, push only this much.

584
00:45:03,060 --> 00:45:09,340
And the next candle is still like this, this candle takes more, there's a chance to go down more.

585
00:45:10,100 --> 00:45:14,820
Can go lower than this. It's broken through. Let's save this first.

586
00:45:15,380 --> 00:45:21,780
Come see the next candle. Now let's see, see? Starting to have fighting back up.

587
00:45:23,540 --> 00:45:26,280
Starting to close as green already, after not seeing green for a long time.

588
00:45:26,900 --> 00:45:30,579
This part green retreated, got hit until retreating to here.

589
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:33,840
It's their territory, can they control here?

590
00:45:35,480 --> 00:45:38,000
Okay, fighting, fighting up.

591
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:41,699
Move this here, because it's a swing point.

592
00:45:43,080 --> 00:45:45,960
How much can they fight back? Because this candle controls, this army.

593
00:45:46,559 --> 00:45:50,559
Like this army already won, it won and moved to set up position here.

594
00:45:50,559 --> 00:45:54,880
Retreated in to attack and take territory like this, so moved large army to here.

595
00:45:55,420 --> 00:46:00,079
This army still controls, see? Need to see if green can come back and fight this army.

596
00:46:00,539 --> 00:46:03,559
Will it come up to here? Let's see.

597
00:46:03,880 --> 00:46:06,900
But could only come up this much, then found red countering in again.

598
00:46:08,700 --> 00:46:09,019
Yeah.

599
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:12,019
Here they also fight back the same.

600
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:12,800
Yeah.

601
00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:16,260
This is very evenly matched.

602
00:46:16,260 --> 00:46:18,579
Even though fighting back, it still fights up.

603
00:46:18,579 --> 00:46:20,559
It's still not two green candles in a row.

604
00:46:21,340 --> 00:46:22,400
Still only this much left.

605
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:24,980
Shows the red side

606
00:46:25,940 --> 00:46:27,000
also won't give up.

607
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:30,380
Still has lots of force left.

608
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:37,539
These 2 candles, momentum is gone. Look carefully.

609
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:42,840
It came down strong like this, but when going up, goes up zigzag zigzag.

610
00:46:42,840 --> 00:46:46,480
No force going up. I think it continues down.

611
00:46:48,260 --> 00:46:51,980
Look here, 2 small candles, this red candle, evenly matched is this candle.

612
00:46:52,280 --> 00:47:00,039
This army was sent like will win, this army already took back. There's a chance it will continue down, and it does go down.

613
00:47:02,860 --> 00:47:09,960
Is the candle big? Big, comparing to this candle, about equal. If zooming, this is big, this one is also big enough compared to

614
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:16,800
this candle, shows the army came to set up new territory. At first set up here, now set up here.

615
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:23,360
Oh, they think they seized it back. Now let's see further.

616
00:47:23,360 --> 00:47:26,019
Like this, small small small small small small small.

617
00:47:27,460 --> 00:47:34,159
Finding a break, considered still, still no force. We'll see if it has force

618
00:47:34,159 --> 00:47:46,780
only when it defeats this army. Meaning defeats, can have green path.

619
00:47:46,780 --> 00:47:52,599
Sent many armies, it becomes reinforcement. Did they win? Already won.

620
00:47:53,620 --> 00:47:57,420
Means we only saw red once. We appeared one two three four five.

621
00:47:57,420 --> 00:48:03,659
Red just appeared candle five six seven still green, shows this army might be starting to

622
00:48:03,659 --> 00:48:08,519
be exhausted already, despite it going. Big candle, remember from where it

623
00:48:08,519 --> 00:48:16,639
then small small small then there's a long candle coming out as this color, it will have momentum force pushing in that direction, in another case.

624
00:48:17,160 --> 00:48:24,599
And if it came down or came in that direction for a period then suddenly a big candle appears, remember there's one chapter,

625
00:48:25,100 --> 00:48:30,739
there's a chance it will be a reversal point, like attacking until the last gasp, traveling all the way,

626
00:48:30,739 --> 00:48:36,300
tired already then attacks with full force, giving all, but the other side tries to resist until running out of energy.

627
00:48:36,700 --> 00:48:40,039
Can win because this one, this candle is considered closing beyond this candle already.

628
00:48:41,220 --> 00:48:45,960
By principle, considered defeating this candle already. This army considered can't fight.

629
00:48:46,340 --> 00:48:49,659
Can inch in, true, but gets slowly, takes more time.

630
00:48:49,659 --> 00:48:52,579
This one like attacking one day, one day hands break, breaking through.

631
00:48:52,579 --> 00:48:58,159
But the green side takes about a week slowly counterattacking.

632
00:48:58,159 --> 00:49:04,780
Yeah, using like this works, comparing like this works, slowly counterattacking. That day there's a chance

633
00:49:06,540 --> 00:49:10,400
to bounce back up. But will it bounce a lot? Will it reverse and go up?

634
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:15,500
When it has to keep watching, like this they start losing energy, losing momentum.

635
00:49:15,500 --> 00:49:19,159
If the next candle goes down, there's a chance to continue down like before, but if it

636
00:49:19,460 --> 00:49:24,300
goes up but how can they fight? They'll try to come attack this army.

637
00:49:24,300 --> 00:49:30,099
Already, big army broken through, left this army, they have to try to come up and attack this army to see if it breaks.

638
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:45,480
If can't attack this army, they continue down, like this army set up and seized this territory.

639
00:49:47,400 --> 00:49:49,639
If can't counterattack, it goes down.

640
00:49:53,400 --> 00:50:01,719
Still can't counterattack, even though sending this big army up, finally still doesn't reach to close here, still going down.

641
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:10,820
Two armies and the two big armies that won, counterattack, it takes back at once,

642
00:50:13,160 --> 00:50:14,719
there's a chance it will go up.

643
00:50:15,320 --> 00:50:20,539
Meaning accumulating energy, sideways already. This will analyze candle by candle for real.

644
00:50:20,539 --> 00:50:24,380
It's hard to analyze, so look at the overall picture, like you explained,

645
00:50:25,920 --> 00:50:29,619
view as forces like I do, or you can compare to whatever you're comfortable with,

646
00:50:30,039 --> 00:50:32,159
and view as momentum like we're viewing.

647
00:50:32,159 --> 00:50:33,820
We might read candlesticks like this.

648
00:50:33,820 --> 00:50:35,519
Might be a story.

649
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:37,360
Like a metaphor.

650
00:50:38,320 --> 00:50:39,679
This one appears.

651
00:50:39,980 --> 00:50:41,199
Was playing, staying just this much.

652
00:50:41,199 --> 00:50:43,659
This one appears above all of these.

653
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:44,920
This army.

654
00:50:44,920 --> 00:50:46,360
Even if won't counterattack.

655
00:50:46,820 --> 00:50:48,300
There's a chance it will gradually

656
00:50:49,240 --> 00:50:50,119
might not win.

657
00:50:50,119 --> 00:50:55,079
Like this period, these red side hit in one shot, one moment reaching.

658
00:50:55,079 --> 00:50:58,440
But green like slowly fights, slowly pushes up, pushes up, pushes up.

659
00:50:58,860 --> 00:51:02,739
Later we'll learn about Dow Theory, will understand more than this.

660
00:51:03,340 --> 00:51:07,960
Because some things talking about momentum alone, sometimes it's hard to predict what's next.

661
00:51:08,920 --> 00:51:12,000
Might be hard, only know they're fighting, evenly matched, that's all.

662
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,619
This period, but if bringing Dow in to combine,

663
00:51:14,619 --> 00:51:19,139
Dow Theory in to combine, there will be reasons to say

664
00:51:19,139 --> 00:51:22,599
there's a chance to go up, there's a chance to go up, if using Dow.

665
00:51:23,320 --> 00:51:27,079
When learning to that point will know, when combining with candlestick momentum,

666
00:51:27,700 --> 00:51:28,860
come see if it really goes up.

667
00:51:31,300 --> 00:51:32,280
It gradually goes.

668
00:51:38,840 --> 00:51:45,139
Still going up.

669
00:51:46,079 --> 00:51:46,739
But

670
00:51:49,240 --> 00:51:51,400
its force isn't as much as here where it went down.

671
00:51:52,700 --> 00:51:56,719
Fighting, not fully evenly matched. If looking at overall momentum, considered close.

672
00:51:57,320 --> 00:52:01,920
But this candle came. This candle came, like setting a base here already.

673
00:52:03,380 --> 00:52:06,500
And fighting if red will win, that's all.

674
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:14,860
Like we see other pairs, this one, this army, is it strong?

675
00:52:15,700 --> 00:52:17,159
Counterattacking them this much.

676
00:52:23,660 --> 00:52:26,760
And green can't fight, can only fight half of this.

677
00:52:27,640 --> 00:52:31,860
And the army has to retreat far down and slowly counterattack, fight up.

678
00:52:31,860 --> 00:52:33,460
No red appearing at all, see?

679
00:52:34,560 --> 00:52:40,280
But momentum, friends in buying, we read the momentum out already, see?

680
00:52:40,900 --> 00:52:46,679
It's a long tail, pushed up throughout, and very long, big candle, very long coming up, coming up until

681
00:52:47,660 --> 00:52:52,659
red is small, green is small. Even though trying to push up,

682
00:52:54,600 --> 00:52:58,019
running out of energy, like will run out of energy. I think.

683
00:52:58,480 --> 00:53:05,739
Called small, trying to fight the army around here.

684
00:53:06,539 --> 00:53:10,000
Finally still can't fight, got about this much, just that here is selling pressure coming back.

685
00:53:10,380 --> 00:53:14,340
Because green is starting to weaken here already, finding force here, fighting back.

686
00:53:15,059 --> 00:53:18,960
These 2 candles together show selling pressure that can fight with these,

687
00:53:19,140 --> 00:53:21,679
the ones that are weak, so it becomes this candle following.

688
00:53:22,460 --> 00:53:27,559
But green tries to push, finally this candle, this army pushes in, still stuck in this zone.

689
00:53:27,559 --> 00:53:30,119
Trying to push, fighting.

690
00:53:35,720 --> 00:53:43,460
Can they fight? Finding this candle going in, have to decide probably can't.

691
00:53:44,620 --> 00:53:48,099
Probably can't, probably will go down more.

692
00:53:50,280 --> 00:53:51,659
Remember, same as before.

693
00:53:52,980 --> 00:53:56,119
Small small small, in a frame then boom appears like this.

694
00:53:57,140 --> 00:53:58,280
Momentum still exists.

695
00:53:58,280 --> 00:54:01,260
Like they've been fighting a lot.

696
00:54:01,260 --> 00:54:04,780
This is considered the period where green troops are weak, see?

697
00:54:04,780 --> 00:54:05,840
Very small.

698
00:54:06,360 --> 00:54:10,579
The red side establishes base and sends troops flooding back in to counterattack.

699
00:54:10,579 --> 00:54:14,719
A candle this size, and can green fight back? How many candles still can't? Half way there. Oh, here it is.

700
00:54:15,240 --> 00:54:18,800
Until gradually fighting upward. Red loses strength and can't fight back.

701
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:23,940
Green pushes up again, showing energy dominated by green. The next candle turned completely red.

702
00:54:25,020 --> 00:54:25,719
Hit this candle.

703
00:54:26,900 --> 00:54:40,559
Green won't give up, pushing up again. Looking at this, there's a chance it will rise here.

704
00:54:40,559 --> 00:54:52,099
But when bears came in to push down and hit this army, it's like playing dead here, completely slaughtered coming down this hard. This army only has the duty of fulfilling downward pressure for sure. So there's a chance it will go down much further.

705
00:54:54,060 --> 00:54:55,840
See that? Then it goes down again.

706
00:54:58,100 --> 00:55:00,639
We read it like this - green fights back.

707
00:55:03,540 --> 00:55:10,420
Fights back, fights back. Can it fight back? Seems like it, but not quite yet.

708
00:55:10,420 --> 00:55:15,400
Why? This army, this army is still waiting.

709
00:55:15,400 --> 00:55:17,679
Green tries to push to not let it go lower than this.

710
00:55:17,679 --> 00:55:19,780
But every time it pushes up, it gets hit back.

711
00:55:20,740 --> 00:55:23,800
Every push up gets hit back. No matter how it pushes up, it gets hit back.

712
00:55:23,800 --> 00:55:25,920
This is still green until finally it gets hit back and turns red.

713
00:55:27,260 --> 00:55:28,739
There's a chance it will continue down.

714
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:31,840
See these two candles? They're holding firm.

715
00:55:32,160 --> 00:55:34,000
Green army can't push up at all.

716
00:55:34,240 --> 00:55:36,219
It pushed up past half of this candle's body already.

717
00:55:36,219 --> 00:55:37,320
Both wicks here.

718
00:55:37,539 --> 00:55:40,340
But in the end, when closing time comes, it gets hit by red army.

719
00:55:40,340 --> 00:55:41,840
Counterattacked on both candles.

720
00:55:42,180 --> 00:55:43,980
Especially this candle, still green.

721
00:55:43,980 --> 00:55:49,440
Still has enough strength. This candle's soldiers are fierce fighters, completely pushed back up.

722
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:55,280
The next candle has a chance, has a chance - let me use the word "chance" - that red will be the winning side.

723
00:55:56,420 --> 00:56:01,539
Right, push, push, can't fight, can't fight, going down, it goes down.

724
00:56:03,200 --> 00:56:08,539
And it should go down more. If it's dropping this much consecutively, here, going way down.

725
00:56:08,539 --> 00:56:13,320
But this zone is green zone, so there might be a lot of their troops defending the trenches.

726
00:56:13,860 --> 00:56:15,980
And then trying to push back up as a Pinbar.

727
00:56:17,160 --> 00:56:18,440
There's a chance it will rise.

728
00:56:19,100 --> 00:56:20,940
Can it push up? Because these 2 candles are holding firm.

729
00:56:21,360 --> 00:56:22,440
Need to watch the next momentum.

730
00:56:24,140 --> 00:56:25,639
Still red.

731
00:56:25,639 --> 00:56:28,159
This one starts to become uncertain.

732
00:56:28,340 --> 00:56:32,460
If it turns green upward, there's a chance showing they're starting to fight upward.

733
00:56:32,460 --> 00:56:37,619
But it shows the force of them pushing back as momentum, pushing back up.

734
00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:46,559
But the next candle couldn't go up again, encountering red pushing down even if just a little bit.

735
00:56:46,559 --> 00:56:51,079
It shows red still has strength, moderately enough, at this moment.

736
00:56:51,700 --> 00:56:56,820
Okay, when encountering this, red itself starts to get tired too.

737
00:57:02,460 --> 00:57:06,159
There's a resting zone, fighting each other, fighting like this is hard to tell.

738
00:57:06,159 --> 00:57:07,219
Which side will win.

739
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:12,079
Just that this zone, repeatedly, and this zone red controls. See? 2 candles control this zone.

740
00:57:12,079 --> 00:57:16,239
If hitting this zone, they already control this zone.

741
00:57:16,620 --> 00:57:21,300
Green zone, this zone controls this zone.

742
00:57:24,040 --> 00:57:32,739
But in the end, green couldn't rise to red's zone at all.

743
00:57:33,140 --> 00:57:37,880
Fighting, fighting, and finally red starts flowing consecutively 3, 4, 5 candles.

744
00:57:40,420 --> 00:57:43,679
And then spacing downward, pushing down, pushing down, next candle turns red like this.

745
00:57:46,440 --> 00:57:54,800
It's quite likely to go down more.

746
00:57:56,620 --> 00:57:57,599
Likely to go down more.

747
00:57:59,460 --> 00:58:01,460
But it's starting to slow down, see?

748
00:58:01,460 --> 00:58:03,179
When red comes down to this candle, it's like slowing down.

749
00:58:03,179 --> 00:58:04,840
Running out of steam. It used force.

750
00:58:04,840 --> 00:58:06,360
During this period, they were concentrated.

751
00:58:06,360 --> 00:58:08,400
Troops marching in, they get tired.

752
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:10,159
It's left with just this, force decreases.

753
00:58:11,540 --> 00:58:12,559
Force is decreasing.

754
00:58:12,559 --> 00:58:17,059
There's a chance the bears might reverse upward, reverse up. That is, green fights back.

755
00:58:17,059 --> 00:58:21,539
Taking territory back. Can it take it? Ah, see? Trying to take it back upward.

756
00:58:21,539 --> 00:58:25,980
But taking it like this, taking like this, I think momentum is still low.

757
00:58:26,460 --> 00:58:29,699
Look, took it and left this much, like this. They took this much.

758
00:58:29,719 --> 00:58:38,099
We can only take up this much. I think there's a chance it will actually continue down. Red candle like this will get revenge because green still can't close at all, see?

759
00:58:38,660 --> 00:58:45,139
There's a chance red, red group, this red army they sent already, these three armies already won, there's a chance to take it further.

760
00:58:45,780 --> 00:58:51,199
There's a chance to go down more. Take that, going down for real, see? So we...

761
00:58:51,199 --> 00:58:53,820
Gradually like this, adding force, adding force coming up, they fight back.

762
00:58:53,820 --> 00:58:56,280
Completely, sending large candles up continuously, because...

763
00:58:56,280 --> 00:59:15,119
Therefore, there's a chance it will break low here, going down more. Ah, but...

764
00:59:17,380 --> 00:59:21,199
Green candles starting to show green's strength already.

765
00:59:21,880 --> 00:59:22,900
They will get revenge.

766
00:59:23,720 --> 00:59:25,619
Starting to send soldiers to fight.

767
00:59:27,539 --> 00:59:30,920
Fighting each other, showing in a range, both sides evenly matched.

768
00:59:34,880 --> 00:59:36,800
How far will they be evenly matched? We'll watch.

769
00:59:37,260 --> 00:59:39,260
See? And then rising, rising together already.

770
00:59:39,260 --> 00:59:44,760
See? Seeing this much shows green is starting to have considerable force coming up.

771
00:59:45,160 --> 00:59:49,539
After being hit by red retreating into their own territory this much, they start buying back.

772
00:59:50,000 --> 01:00:09,239
And encounter this candle coming up, right here. Green-green. Normally it goes green-green, red-red.

773
01:00:09,239 --> 01:00:16,820
Going that direction, red controls this area. Red controls this area here, trying to fight back this area but can't.

774
01:00:16,820 --> 01:00:20,360
Looking down, this candle is about to get revenge on this candle, coming up.

775
01:00:21,980 --> 01:00:26,840
If getting revenge on this candle, they'll try to get revenge on candles around here.

776
01:00:28,039 --> 01:00:32,340
Well, whether they can get revenge or not, how will they try to go up? We'll see how far they can try to go up.

777
01:00:32,579 --> 01:00:37,099
But this candle, I think it should continue. Should have strength to continue.

778
01:00:37,099 --> 01:00:42,000
Let's see. Ah, it can go. But starting to lose momentum as well.

779
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:46,199
Starting to decrease. Tired. It's tiring to fight back.

780
01:00:46,199 --> 01:00:47,519
Starting to decrease.

781
01:00:49,940 --> 01:00:52,059
Okay, when I see this, curving like this.

782
01:00:54,580 --> 01:00:58,940
Might still, might still not come up to, should rest coming down first.

783
01:00:59,840 --> 01:01:02,179
And then consolidate below because not much force. Here there's a lot of force.

784
01:01:02,940 --> 01:01:06,880
And left with just this candle, little force, need to rest.

785
01:01:07,780 --> 01:01:11,539
Encountering this candle, it must go down.

786
01:01:13,100 --> 01:01:14,360
Red side is about to get revenge.

787
01:01:17,840 --> 01:01:18,679
Going down.

788
01:01:20,140 --> 01:01:23,340
See? Coming down, but coming down and green won't give up either.

789
01:01:23,620 --> 01:01:27,159
Looking at this condition, and this wave, there's still a chance to go up more.

790
01:01:29,740 --> 01:01:32,800
Still going down. Ah, like encountering this green candle confirms that...

791
01:01:33,180 --> 01:01:36,579
This area definitely has force, because around this area...

792
01:01:36,820 --> 01:01:40,940
Green candle already holds this, see? And this candle holds it back.

793
01:01:41,140 --> 01:01:53,320
Sending reinforcements. How much chance to fight back?

794
01:01:53,320 --> 01:01:56,260
There's still a chance it will push upward.

795
01:01:57,340 --> 01:02:00,519
But after watching for a while, momentum starts to decrease.

796
01:02:01,020 --> 01:02:05,260
Not much force. Not confident. Let's wait and see.

797
01:02:06,080 --> 01:02:08,360
In the end, which side wins? Can move.

798
01:02:09,060 --> 01:02:10,639
So we read charts like this.

799
01:02:12,320 --> 01:02:13,739
Reading as a story like this.

800
01:02:14,240 --> 01:02:15,880
Gradually sitting and analyzing, gradually thinking.

801
01:02:16,640 --> 01:02:21,480
We'll keep going. But just reading like this alone, we only look at candlesticks, sometimes it might...

802
01:02:22,960 --> 01:02:28,579
Um, somehow, it's still not exactly 100 percent right.

803
01:02:28,579 --> 01:02:45,860
We need to use it together with other things that will be in the next parts.

804
01:02:46,560 --> 01:02:49,400
Bring it to read together with Momentum that we learned.

805
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:51,820
That we're talking about.

806
01:02:52,400 --> 01:02:54,460
Hope you understand more.

807
01:02:55,880 --> 01:02:57,860
In the end, they say...

808
01:02:58,640 --> 01:03:00,800
Price is king. Price is...

809
01:03:01,760 --> 01:03:02,579
The biggest.

810
01:03:03,740 --> 01:03:06,099
Everything else is secondary. That is, other things...

811
01:03:06,280 --> 01:03:06,980
Come down.

812
01:03:08,540 --> 01:03:09,780
Price is price.

813
01:03:09,780 --> 01:03:11,840
Price is these candlesticks.

814
01:03:11,840 --> 01:03:12,940
It consists of 4 prices.

815
01:03:13,300 --> 01:03:13,860
Therefore...

816
01:03:14,300 --> 01:03:16,699
If you can read Momentum as a story...

817
01:03:17,800 --> 01:03:18,539
It works.

818
01:03:18,920 --> 01:03:24,079
They say there's no Advanced level of Pattern of candlesticks like which type.

819
01:03:24,079 --> 01:03:28,360
This one encounters this candle, encounters this Pattern, definitely up, definitely down as Advanced level.

820
01:03:28,360 --> 01:03:29,699
We must remember there isn't.

821
01:03:29,699 --> 01:03:31,920
There's only deep understanding.

822
01:03:32,180 --> 01:03:34,980
Very deep in price movement.

823
01:03:34,980 --> 01:03:36,619
It's Momentum.

824
01:03:37,160 --> 01:03:43,820
If we focus correctly, we'll be able to go all ways, understand charts more and more.

825
01:03:44,260 --> 01:03:47,380
So I'll end the Candlestick Part here, which is Part 1.

826
01:03:47,579 --> 01:03:50,260
Candlestick, that's it. Thank you very much.
