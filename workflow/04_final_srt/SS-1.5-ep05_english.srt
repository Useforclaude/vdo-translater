1
00:00:03,660 --> 00:00:07,080
Let's take a look at stocks, because it also works with stocks the same way.

2
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:29,039
Let's try switching to Apple. I prepared this earlier because these two sections are quite similar. They're both three-peak patterns exactly the same.

3
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:33,780
Same pattern, see? But why did one go up and the other go down? Let's take a look. At this point.

4
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:39,020
Just remember this image first. Okay, same pattern. Let's look at this point first. Zoom in.

5
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:53,179
If you just look at this, when price came up to this point, same as before. We find the swing. Price swung up here.

6
00:00:53,439 --> 00:00:57,679
This one is the highest peak on the right. And it's right here.

7
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:03,280
Look, is there Action? Here's the Action, rising strongly. Reaction is this one.

8
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:12,879
This one isn't it, it must be this color. See? They're evenly matched.

9
00:01:12,879 --> 00:01:19,579
So at this point, is there a lot of Reaction force going down? Not a lot. There's little, not enough to go down significantly.

10
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:23,700
It came down about this much. Do you remember the formula? The formula, if it becomes a pattern like this.

11
00:01:24,239 --> 00:01:29,120
Suppose it becomes a Triple top, right? At this point there must be little force going down. Little down force, but a lot of Reaction force. Going down a lot, that's when it breaks out.

12
00:01:29,739 --> 00:01:34,780
Let's see how it turns out. It's about here. Once this is done, it moves over.

13
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:40,400
So it swings to this point. This is Action Reaction going up. So it runs up.

14
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:44,859
See? It came up about the same level as before. Because at this point there's a lot of force. It keeps running up.

15
00:01:48,840 --> 00:02:07,560
Coming to this point. Actually I would count this point. Count at this point.

16
00:02:07,879 --> 00:02:13,500
I choose to use this candlestick. Because actually it swung up to here.

17
00:02:15,199 --> 00:02:24,719
Then it came down and swung number one, like with stocks. With stocks, the price might not be exactly like forex.

18
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:33,740
It might have an open swing that comes here, it might fill the swing here first. Let's take a look.

19
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:39,759
Currently at this point. This is Action, this is Reaction. About halfway.

20
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:49,379
So you see? The force going down here isn't a lot yet. It only came down this much and went back up.

21
00:02:49,939 --> 00:02:54,419
Went back up. Now we'll observe at this point. We'll get this.

22
00:02:54,419 --> 00:03:00,180
This is Action, and Reaction. See? So hitting here, is it strong? It's quite strong. It is strong.

23
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:05,099
But it came down. The word 'strong' means there's a chance it could come back and beat the old Low.

24
00:03:05,099 --> 00:03:12,060
Look at where it came down. Right here. Step step step step step. At this point.

25
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:14,900
It beat it, lower than that. Which is at this point. So we'll count this point as where it bounced back up.

26
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:20,599
So here becomes the axis. But look at this point.

27
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:25,539
See at this point? This exceeds halfway, so we count it. It goes up, up up up.

28
00:03:25,919 --> 00:03:30,900
And then slams down. At this point, on this side we can barely find it. We'll find it again here.

29
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:38,139
Is there Reaction? There's no Reaction. This one doesn't exceed. See? Just this much isn't enough. So it didn't go up at all. It went down further.

30
00:03:38,139 --> 00:03:46,039
So it went down further because the upward force, the upward Reaction force, there's nothing to push it up at this point.

31
00:03:48,379 --> 00:03:57,979
It went down further. Because if we follow our Momentum, the downward force is still a lot.

32
00:03:57,979 --> 00:03:58,960
The selling force slammed down this much. And when we measure Action Reaction from here, it's a lot, you see? The Reaction side is a lot.

33
00:03:59,639 --> 00:04:01,360
Its force is still strong downward like this. It came up, came up, came up. Didn't reach here. Not enough force.

34
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:03,060
We measured earlier. It came down. But it didn't go up at this point. Until it came down to here. This is another swing.

35
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:04,919
When it gets to this point, what is this? Action Reaction is here, see that it's higher?

36
00:04:05,159 --> 00:04:06,500
When comparing this point with this point, or this one with this one, this is Reaction that has much stronger force than before.

37
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:07,780
So the price will run upward, and rush up. This high beats it, it's very strong, so it takes this High, not this High.

38
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:09,340
This is the answer. Not taking this High, this is the latest High. At this point.

39
00:04:09,819 --> 00:04:13,199
At this point there's already a chance to beat it from here going up. But the question is, why at this point?

40
00:04:13,199 --> 00:04:13,979
You have to look at this too. It's called looking at its distance. About this much for one. And from here to another one.

41
00:04:13,979 --> 00:04:15,659
See that the distance is about the same? Evenly matched, close to each other. So we'll count it as a quasi-cycle. As a cycle.

42
00:04:15,659 --> 00:04:19,800
As a recurring pattern. One wave here, one wave here. That it should go up.

43
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:22,399
So I count at this High. It has a chance to rally up. This one counts as resistance for sure. Hits hits hits at this point.

44
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:28,019
This is the point we'll look at again. Where it went Sideways and stuck. The third one might have to go down like this.

45
00:04:28,019 --> 00:04:29,860
Let's find out, at this third range, is there anywhere hitting strongly down? That would break down from here like this.

46
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:32,600
So it would become a Triple top. After it swung down, we have to move to this one.

47
00:04:33,019 --> 00:04:36,680
The line is right here. So when price fell to this red one, this block becomes Action, while the green becomes Reaction at this point.

48
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:42,560
Price will surge up. It has to go down further. Beat this High going up. Down down down.

49
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:54,379
I'll tell you that in the end, from this point, the price here is quite a lot. The force sending here is quite a lot.

50
00:04:54,379 --> 00:04:57,819
It will bring the price running up until it reaches this level. According to the force being strong from here already.

51
00:04:57,819 --> 00:05:02,060
In a close cycle. Let's go back. Starting from this point, right?

52
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:05,339
See? It'll be close to each other. Price runs up to about this range exactly.

53
00:05:05,339 --> 00:05:12,540
Now it will break out to another one at this point. At this point it zigzags. You have to try to analyze this, at this point.

54
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:15,779
Here, going up. The one hitting down is at this point. Here's the one going up. Like this, so it couldn't go up much.

55
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:19,420
Came down to this point. At this point the force is stronger. Stronger than here. So it could come up to this point. Beat this High.

56
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:21,959
Because at this point it has higher force than here. And at this point it beat it too.

57
00:05:23,699 --> 00:05:29,339
It's not saying it will go up this much. But it does beat the old High. The latest one is right here. How much?

58
00:05:29,339 --> 00:05:36,139
From this point. See? Measuring the green here, Reaction won. It went up.

59
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:42,920
But from the big one, at this point that says it must go up and beat this High already, it came up all the way to this one.

60
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:46,899
When it gets to this point, we know the same thing. This means at this point, the third point of this one must be the strongest. It must be around here.

61
00:05:46,899 --> 00:05:59,319
Let's take a look. Now let's look at this peak first. This peak. We'll use this one.

62
00:05:59,319 --> 00:06:00,300
Is there Action? There is Action. Action is here. Action real time, Reaction that exceeds halfway.

63
00:06:01,139 --> 00:06:04,879
It gets about this much, about this one, about halfway, but here it's right here.

64
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:08,500
See that it's very different from this? So can it go down strongly? It can't go down strongly. It only came down this much.

65
00:06:08,939 --> 00:06:13,120
Going up further. Going up further, which line will it get? It'll get this one, at this point.

66
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:17,899
The Action side. This will be this one. The Reaction will be this one. It already exceeds halfway. They match.

67
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:19,759
See? Is the force enough? It's not enough to come down this much. Not at all, it's less than before.

68
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:38,019
This one is still at this point. One is at this point. Both are little. Both are little, so swinging to this point.

69
00:06:38,839 --> 00:06:42,779
Here it went down little. It only managed to get this much. But when you look at this point. At this point.

70
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:53,240
And this is Action, we'll get this green here. While Reaction is this red that fell down.

71
00:06:54,399 --> 00:07:02,639
See that it's a lot? From little, a lot at this point. Strong force falling down all the way to here. All the way to here.

72
00:07:03,819 --> 00:07:10,319
Once it reaches here, can it continue going down right away? If it's going to continue down, it should be, what's it called, rally up a bit.

73
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:12,720
Come down like this and go up, then at this point it has to be strong again and fall down further.

74
00:07:13,279 --> 00:07:16,680
But here it fell down. At this point it supported it. Like this. Can it go up strongly?

75
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:19,579
This one, when it came up, will it become an uptrend continuing? At this point when it came up, you see? These three.

76
00:07:19,579 --> 00:07:24,439
One two three peaks, and it continues up. At first we didn't know. At this point we didn't know. In hindsight it has to be three peaks. Peak one, peak two.

77
00:07:24,439 --> 00:07:27,819
Peak three, then continue up? We have to look at this point. Mostly at this point, will it go down strongly? We already know it goes down strongly.

78
00:07:28,459 --> 00:07:31,819
Because it's stronger than the previous two times. So it slammed down this far. But it supports here.

79
00:07:32,779 --> 00:07:37,639
It's around the support level. Fell and might go up. Let's look at its force. At this point it becomes Action.

80
00:07:38,819 --> 00:07:43,160
And Reaction is this one. Can it fight? It can't fight. It can't fight, so it goes up little.

81
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:49,220
It came up just this much, doesn't beat this High. Simply put, whether it goes up little or a lot.

82
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:53,040
If you can't guess, it still doesn't beat the old High. It still goes, runs but still doesn't beat the old High.

83
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:56,500
Slams down. Meets this one. Swings a bit. Slams down. Is there strong downward force?

84
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:59,759
This is the Action force, and the Reaction force of this one, because this one doesn't exceed halfway.

85
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:02,939
So we take this one. It's still less than this. Doesn't go down at all, see? Somehow it doesn't flow down.

86
00:08:02,939 --> 00:08:07,639
Huh? Or is it still an uptrend? Goes up again, where does it meet? The High before swinging down.

87
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:13,000
It must be this one. It already broke down. See? Look at the Reaction, it's still little. This one is little too. Is this one going down?

88
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,980
Not yet down. Huh? Or will it go up? So, it came down to this one. This one still says it won't go up.

89
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:18,439
Because, see that this green and this red, this green doesn't beat this. It still can't go up. Still can't beat the High.

90
00:08:19,459 --> 00:08:23,279
If I want to try drawing a line, a bit, it would be about this. Resistance level right around this area.

91
00:08:23,279 --> 00:08:25,180
Coming down. Can it go up strongly? If it goes up strongly, it can't go up again. How?

92
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:27,620
Stuck here, there's no force to go up. Cannot beat the High. Because it came up this swing and fell down.

93
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:28,420
Suppose we only see up to here. Can we still measure it yet? Because we don't know the swing point yet, right?

94
00:08:29,939 --> 00:08:30,639
Action must be this candle already. The green Action that becomes Action continues behind.

95
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:41,000
While Reaction will become this one. See? It becomes that at this point it's a lot now.

96
00:08:41,899 --> 00:08:47,139
Previously it wasn't a lot yet. There's this one point where it's a lot. Then it fell here. So it broke out.

97
00:08:47,139 --> 00:08:51,919
You broke out. Actually, can we count it as a downtrend? We can count it already. HIGH-LOW, LOWER-HIGH, LOWER-LOW, LOWER-HIGH.

98
00:08:51,919 --> 00:08:56,779
Next doesn't need to be LOWER-LOW already. If we put them together, this we talk just casually about candlesticks and everything.

99
00:09:02,179 --> 00:09:09,539
Which is ACTION and REACTION, we just look at this much. If anyone looks more than this, you see many more signals already.

100
00:09:09,539 --> 00:09:13,480
As for those who learned Season 2, you see this wave series. You already know what the future will be. Very precisely for sure.

101
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:19,120
And this one comes to confirm it makes you play more accurately. Let's look at this. See? ACTION and REACTION.

102
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:26,759
Because at this point it's a lot. This is a lot of force going down. And in the end where did it go down to?

103
00:09:27,639 --> 00:09:33,600
It has to go down and beat the old Low already. So it goes down, flows down. About this much, see the difference between the two periods.

104
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:44,559
That have the same pattern exactly. Both are three heads exactly the same. But one it doesn't take down. It takes up.

105
00:09:45,379 --> 00:09:51,460
But at this point it says take down. Because you see the points are different. The balance measurement that it says.

106
00:09:52,379 --> 00:09:58,460
Here, price runs up, runs up, runs up. Does it say anything? Why does price keep running up?

107
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:06,779
Uh, let's look at the daily chart instead. Let's look at the daily. See?

108
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:15,759
Here, price was running running running running running around this area. And then it ran up.

109
00:10:16,559 --> 00:10:19,320
Which point made it run up? Starting from beating this High. You look at this one.

110
00:10:19,659 --> 00:10:21,480
See? Here is the lowest. Measure it. This is its axis. Action Reaction.

111
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:23,539
See clearly? See that it beats this? Anyway it will beat this High for sure. From this series.

112
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:26,559
It's already telling if you can see and read. That's all. It has traces. There are still many more today.

113
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:29,600
But it might not be told in this class. This one just takes this topic, see that it says, here, anyway it will exceed.

114
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,639
It might come up zigzagging, not smoothly. But we have signals already that anyway it will reach. It came to reach until achieved.

115
00:10:31,639 --> 00:10:33,759
To summarize, came down to rest according to normal price patterns. And then continue. That's all.

116
00:10:33,759 --> 00:10:36,399
If we look in periods, came up, came down. Now will it break, will it be able to go up again?

117
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:42,019
At which point? At this point. See? It still can't go up. See? The force is better than before.

118
00:10:42,779 --> 00:10:43,960
At this point? Counting this one. See? Red. Action still beats. So it couldn't go up far. Not past this point yet.

119
00:10:45,679 --> 00:10:48,259
Came up. Fell to this point. Count, this swing counts new. This swing has good force. Going up, it goes up.

120
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:51,600
Strong hitting on the ladder, will it slam down? The downward hitting force, it's not a lot. Here it's not a lot. So it doesn't take down, that's all.

121
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:56,960
Now at this point. This is Bitcoin. Crypto can still be used. Already said that the technique can be used everywhere if you can read.

122
00:10:56,960 --> 00:11:01,279
Does it beat? It beats. Goes up. Done. No tricks. See? Candlesticks don't trick. Price doesn't trick.

123
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:09,720
You just know what it is, the price source. That's all. But the graph you see, you see like, see casually like this.

124
00:11:12,759 --> 00:11:17,879
You know what? What is it saying? Can't see it at all. Suppose we haven't seen the next period yet.

125
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:22,399
Where to look? This one is big red. This one is big green. Directly, do they cancel each other or what? All confused.

126
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:27,080
This is the way to look. One part. In this part. The part before this, part one, you read momentum.

127
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:31,440
Did the small beat the large, fight each other? Couldn't fight, so it keeps going up. This big green has high force.

128
00:11:31,899 --> 00:11:32,799
You follow the story. It tells a story, how it came. Those who learned Season 2 came. You look at this, it's a secret inside.

129
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:42,899
Says how it is. Actually from this series, it already says that price will continue up.

130
00:11:42,899 --> 00:11:44,039
Those who learned Season 2, you'll know in advance already. That's all. Okay?

131
00:11:44,039 --> 00:11:45,759
So that you understand, you'll have complete components. The more you use this part and that part, whoever learns a lot is better off.

132
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:50,740
Learn everything completely, you bring them to combine together. You'll read the chart much better than others for sure.

133
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:56,799
From all these secrets. All these secrets. I wish you good luck.

134
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:58,059
This green doesn't beat this.

135
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:00,580
It still can't go up. Still can't beat the High.

136
00:12:01,559 --> 00:12:03,919
If I want to try drawing a line, a bit.

137
00:12:06,019 --> 00:12:07,700
It would be about this.

138
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:10,559
Resistance level right around this area.

139
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:14,600
Coming down. Can it go up strongly? If it goes up strongly, it can't go up again.

140
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:18,139
How? Stuck here, there's no force to go up. Cannot beat the High.

141
00:12:18,139 --> 00:12:21,960
Because it came up this swing and fell down. Suppose we only see up to here.

142
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:40,539
Can we still measure it yet? Because we don't know the swing point yet, right?

143
00:12:41,019 --> 00:12:42,940
Action must be this candle already. Action.

144
00:12:44,299 --> 00:12:46,100
The green that becomes Action continues behind.

145
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:49,000
While Reaction will become this one. See?

146
00:12:50,679 --> 00:12:54,740
It becomes that at this point it's a lot now. Previously it wasn't a lot yet.

147
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:57,279
There's this one point where it's a lot. Then it fell here.

148
00:12:57,279 --> 00:12:59,820
So it broke out. You broke out.

149
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:02,559
Actually, can we count it as a downtrend? We can count it already.

150
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:06,519
HIGH-LOW, LOWER-HIGH, LOWER-LOW, LOWER-HIGH.

151
00:13:06,519 --> 00:13:07,779
Next doesn't need to be LOWER-LOW already.

152
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,559
If we put them together.

153
00:13:09,559 --> 00:13:16,019
This we talk just casually about the candlestick set and everything.

154
00:13:16,019 --> 00:13:18,879
Which is ACTION and REACTION.

155
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:20,559
We just look at this much.

156
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:23,919
If anyone looks more than this, you see many more signals already.

157
00:13:26,179 --> 00:13:28,379
As for those who learned Season 2, you see this wave series.

158
00:13:28,379 --> 00:13:31,039
You already know what the future will be. Very precisely for sure.

159
00:13:32,139 --> 00:13:34,799
And this one comes to confirm it, makes you play more accurately.

160
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:38,220
Let's look at this. See? ACTION and REACTION.

161
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:39,519
Because dragging this down a lot.

162
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:42,519
This is a lot of force going down.

163
00:13:42,519 --> 00:13:44,379
And in the end where did it go down to? It has to go down and beat it.

164
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:47,759
Look at the old one first. It goes down, flows down.

165
00:13:49,159 --> 00:13:54,240
About this much, see the difference between the two periods that have the same pattern exactly.

166
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:57,440
Both are three heads exactly the same. But one it doesn't take down. It takes up.

167
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:00,899
But at this point it says take down. Because you see the points are different.

168
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:17,580
The balance measurement that it says. The weight it gives.

169
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:21,279
Here, price runs up, runs up, runs up. Does it say anything?

170
00:14:21,659 --> 00:14:25,200
Why does price keep running up? Uh, let's look at the daily chart instead.

171
00:14:26,799 --> 00:14:27,659
Let's look at the daily. Good.

172
00:14:31,059 --> 00:14:36,120
See? Here, price was running running running running running around this area.

173
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:40,379
And then it ran up. Which point made it run up?

174
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:44,740
Starting from beating this High. You look at this one. See? Here is the lowest.

175
00:14:46,139 --> 00:14:53,700
Measure it. This is its axis.

176
00:14:55,519 --> 00:15:00,659
Action Reaction, see clearly?

177
00:15:02,519 --> 00:15:07,960
See that it beats this? Anyway it will beat this High for sure. From this series.

178
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:12,799
It's already telling, just can you see and read?

179
00:15:12,799 --> 00:15:18,559
That's all. It has traces. There are still many more today. But it might not be told in this class.

180
00:15:18,559 --> 00:15:22,220
This one just takes this topic, see that it says, here, anyway it will exceed.

181
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:29,279
It might come up zigzagging, not smoothly. But we have signals already that anyway it will reach.

182
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:37,639
It came to reach until achieved. To summarize, came down to rest according to normal price patterns. And then continue.

183
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:47,440
That's all. If we look in periods, came up, came down. Now will it break, will it be able to go up again?

184
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:58,360
At which point? At this point. See? It still can't go up. See? The force is better than before.

185
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:09,559
At this point? Counting this one. See? Red. Action still beats. So it couldn't go up far.

186
00:16:09,559 --> 00:16:17,159
Not past this point yet. Came up. Fell to this point. Count, this swing counts new. This swing has good force.

187
00:16:17,159 --> 00:16:20,580
Going up, it goes up. Strong hitting on the ladder, will it slam down?

188
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:23,220
The downward hitting force, it's not a lot. Here it's not a lot.

189
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:26,500
So it doesn't take down, that's all. Now at this point.

190
00:16:27,899 --> 00:16:30,000
This is Bitcoin. Crypto can still be used.

191
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,220
Already said that the technique can be used everywhere if you can read.

192
00:16:40,059 --> 00:16:44,740
Does it beat? It beats. Goes up. Done. No tricks.

193
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:47,700
See? Candlesticks don't trick. Price doesn't trick.

194
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:50,019
You just need to know how to read the clues that price is showing you.

195
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:53,139
That's all. But the graph you see, you see like,

196
00:16:54,179 --> 00:16:56,980
see casually like this. You know what? What is it saying?

197
00:16:56,980 --> 00:16:59,659
Can't see it at all. Suppose we haven't seen the next period yet.

198
00:17:00,039 --> 00:17:03,580
Where to look? This one is big red. This one is big green.

199
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:06,700
Directly, do they cancel each other or what? All confused.

200
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:09,920
This is the way to look. One part. In this part.

201
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:13,900
The part before this, part one, you read momentum.

202
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:17,980
Can the main force on this side fight back? They can't win, so it keeps going up.

203
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:22,119
This big green has high force. You follow the story. It tells a story, how it came.

204
00:17:22,519 --> 00:17:26,640
Those who learned Season 2, you look at this, it's a secret inside.

205
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:27,720
Says how it is.

206
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:31,619
Actually from this series, it already says that price will continue up.

207
00:17:31,619 --> 00:17:35,160
Those who learned Season 2, you'll know in advance already.

208
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:44,319
That's all. Okay? So that you understand, you'll have complete components. The more you use this part and that part, whoever learns a lot is better off.

209
00:17:44,319 --> 00:17:49,980
Learn everything completely, you bring them to combine together. You'll read the chart much better than others for sure.

210
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:54,579
From all these secrets. All these secrets. I wish you good luck.
