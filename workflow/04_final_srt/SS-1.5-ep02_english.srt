1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,240
Alright, Episode 2! We already know we're comparing this to a balance scale, right? So how many patterns does a balance scale have?

2
00:00:06,759 --> 00:00:29,980
When I say "patterns," I don't mean what it looks like - I mean the different ways this balance scale can measure forces. What kind of readings can we get?

3
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:34,939
Basically, one side starts having more weight than the other.

4
00:00:35,719 --> 00:00:37,380
And then we get a second scenario like this.

5
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:38,359
What's this side?

6
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:39,799
Which side is this?

7
00:00:40,439 --> 00:00:45,659
Action and Reaction - what is this side?

8
00:00:45,659 --> 00:00:50,899
Action is stronger - the Action force is greater than the Reaction force.

9
00:00:51,979 --> 00:00:54,119
This one's balanced. Pattern one - already covered.

10
00:00:54,799 --> 00:01:03,840
Pattern two and pattern three. Pattern three is basically - yeah - Action and Reaction, what's this side?

11
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:08,459
Reaction has the stronger force. Now I'm talking about just one direction here.

12
00:01:08,459 --> 00:01:16,260
Like a downtrend - coming down, down, down, and then you see this pattern - a group of candlesticks forming.

13
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:22,340
Like this. And then it goes up like this - reverses. If it was an uptrend...

14
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:26,799
Uptrend reversing to downtrend - just flip it to the opposite. But right now...

15
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:30,700
Everyone getting this? Doesn't matter what direction - this side that acts first...

16
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:46,239
We call it Action. When it bounces back, that's the Reaction.

17
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:50,799
So Action on this side - the action comes out. These candlesticks are selling pressure.

18
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:56,200
Pushing down, down, down continuously. Then it hits and反s back like this.

19
00:01:56,200 --> 00:02:00,099
From a Pin Bar pattern like this, the Reaction forms.

20
00:02:00,099 --> 00:02:16,219
Whether it's big or small, we'll need to examine that. For now, we're learning the theory first.

21
00:02:16,219 --> 00:02:20,199
We've got Action and Reaction on two sides like this - kind of like this. If I draw it simpler for you...

22
00:02:20,199 --> 00:02:23,819
It'll look something like this. But is this complete yet?

23
00:02:23,819 --> 00:02:28,259
Not yet, folks. Let's see what else we need.

24
00:02:28,259 --> 00:02:31,939
What we're looking for - first thing is, we need to identify Action and Reaction.

25
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:37,599
Second, it has to have TWO sides. So this is the candlestick pattern...

26
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:40,379
That we're after. Since we need it, we gotta count it, right?

27
00:02:40,379 --> 00:02:43,120
It needs specific components - one, there has to be a candlestick here.

28
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:47,099
The middle candlestick - that's the axis of our balance scale.

29
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:54,159
Right? We need the axis - the central pivot point.

30
00:02:54,699 --> 00:02:59,599
And we need arms on both sides, right? Otherwise we can't measure the forces or weights.

31
00:03:00,099 --> 00:03:04,240
So we need candlesticks like this. Bottom line - we need at least three candlesticks total.

32
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:10,340
But what if it looks like this instead? Does it work? Not yet.

33
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:14,780
We still need the axis. Earlier we had an axis like this.

34
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:18,960
Dividing two sides. This side we already know - left side from now on is Action.

35
00:03:19,479 --> 00:03:24,659
Right side is Reaction. And we need candlesticks - we need arms on both sides.

36
00:03:24,659 --> 00:03:28,360
So we need candlesticks on either side of the center one.

37
00:03:30,439 --> 00:03:35,479
Two sides - one, two, three. But that's not enough. We just learned that sometimes it flows.

38
00:03:36,099 --> 00:03:38,740
Hits this pattern and flows - it doesn't form on this side.

39
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,400
When it flows like that, we're missing the fourth element.

40
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:48,960
What's the fourth element? Right here - what needs to happen is in this zone.

41
00:03:49,259 --> 00:03:55,419
Support and resistance. Yeah, we've got the scale, we've got two arms.

42
00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:00,319
And it's happening in this area - right in this zone.

43
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:01,699
This is what's occurring.

44
00:04:02,719 --> 00:04:08,659
And we're gonna count - yeah, I could call it "five" if you want.

45
00:04:08,659 --> 00:04:11,199
These are things to memorize. I'm calling them "things to remember."

46
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:14,979
You need to understand them and memorize them. Better than just calling them "rules." So rule five is...

47
00:04:15,819 --> 00:04:19,399
We're gonna count price on the axis candlestick. Let's talk about the axis first.

48
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:24,639
The axis - yeah - no matter what it looks like, whatever the shape...

49
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:37,480
The one that's in the middle and occurs at resistance - we count the LOWEST point.

50
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:49,000
This is a key rule. Count the lowest point - that means INCLUDING the wick.

51
00:04:50,139 --> 00:04:52,819
Right now there's no wick showing. Or maybe there is one - doesn't matter.

52
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:55,160
If there's a wick like this, we count this as the lowest point.

53
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:57,699
This wick here - take the lowest point first.

54
00:04:57,699 --> 00:04:59,360
You might ask, "Why are we counting this?"

55
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:02,620
It's not counting like one, two, three, four, five - I mean, what do we call it?

56
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:08,759
It's an important reference point we need to keep track of.

57
00:05:08,939 --> 00:05:10,639
How we're gonna use it? Let's look.

58
00:05:10,939 --> 00:05:14,699
We keep this point first. This one here - we include the wick, remember?

59
00:05:14,699 --> 00:05:19,459
Just for the axis candlestick. Next rule, or next point...

60
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:25,500
The next point is about the arms.

61
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:31,079
Got it? We have the axis, and we need the arms of the scale.

62
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:37,040
For the axis - right here - we count the LOWEST price point of that candlestick.

63
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:44,199
That specific one, including the wick. But for the arms - the arms on the Action and Reaction sides...

64
00:05:44,759 --> 00:05:48,600
We count ONLY the candlestick body. Even if it has a wick...

65
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:57,480
Count ONLY the body. Just the body, alright?

66
00:05:57,879 --> 00:06:04,019
No matter what it looks like, same rule - just the body only.

67
00:06:05,839 --> 00:06:10,699
Only the body. Even if the wick is this long or whatever.

68
00:06:10,699 --> 00:06:14,660
Don't count it. Body only - just the body.

69
00:06:16,079 --> 00:06:19,339
So how many rules do we have now? These are things we need to remember.

70
00:06:19,339 --> 00:06:22,560
Hold on, there's more. Not done yet.

71
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:28,540
We're also gonna use this criterion too - because of this...

72
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,699
I'm not just teaching Forex here. This can be used in ANY market.

73
00:06:33,339 --> 00:06:39,379
Whether it's Forex, stocks, gold, oil - whatever.

74
00:06:39,379 --> 00:06:42,740
So I need to explain it inclusively like this.

75
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:46,240
Because sometimes people might get confused, like "The chart would never look like that!"

76
00:06:46,579 --> 00:06:50,439
Some markets that aren't currency or Forex - it can happen.

77
00:06:50,439 --> 00:06:53,439
The chart can move however it wants.

78
00:06:53,639 --> 00:07:00,519
But in Forex, when it opens and closes, it connects perfectly. But other markets might have gaps and all that stuff.

79
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:08,459
So the next criterion is - the body of the arms, on both sides. The arms - the bodies...

80
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:17,060
Find the 50% mark. 50% - half of that body. Don't count the wick - I already said, don't count wicks.

81
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:21,660
Take half. Half - no matter how small or big it is.

82
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:23,459
Take half. You might ask, "What do we do with this half?"

83
00:07:24,879 --> 00:07:29,180
Compare that half to the axis. The axis candlestick.

84
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:47,040
How do we compare? Take this one - it's specific to the axis, gotta separate them out.

85
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:51,680
Even if the top part is really long, we don't count it. Count this part.

86
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:56,339
Count the body separately. And this body extends out to both sides.

87
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:03,839
Like an axis like this. And then the arms extend straight out like this.

88
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:10,220
All along these arm lines - all the candlesticks along these arm lines...

89
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:13,180
That we're counting as arms of the balance scale...

90
00:08:14,199 --> 00:08:17,300
They must exceed 50%.

91
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:20,800
Must be more than half of the body.

92
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:29,079
This is what we'll use to consider and analyze things.

93
00:08:29,079 --> 00:08:33,320
Like for example, this one - it looks like this.

94
00:08:35,559 --> 00:08:38,679
Where's the halfway point of this one?

95
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:42,720
Half is still right here. See how it's lower than this point?

96
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:47,320
Lower, yeah. So this candlestick we WON'T consider.

97
00:08:48,039 --> 00:08:52,840
I'm using the word "consider" here. This one works. This one works.

98
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:57,860
But this one? Half is here - lower than this. This one doesn't count.

99
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:02,580
Getting it? Can you visualize? Both sides - both arms.

100
00:09:03,159 --> 00:09:08,080
Action and Reaction - take the ones exceeding half. Count body only, not wicks.

101
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:12,419
Body only - we use just that for analysis.

102
00:09:12,799 --> 00:09:15,000
Let me summarize again in a bit. What do we have so far?

103
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:23,480
So Action and Reaction - we'll get a gain roughly like that.

104
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:29,539
Okay, let's count them up. How does it work?

105
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:43,840
First thing - what do we have? We have the axis, right? One, two, three - we have arms.

106
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:52,340
Three things so far. Then we add - support and resistance - that's four. Count the low point, include wick - that's five.

107
00:09:53,059 --> 00:09:53,460
Five - count the low, include wick - five.

108
00:09:54,759 --> 00:10:04,259
Yeah, and take the halfway point - that's six. Count body only.

109
00:10:04,259 --> 00:10:10,340
The arms - the arms of the candlesticks - wait, the arms of the balance scale that are candlesticks - count body only.

110
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:16,879
That's seven. Seven now. Now take the price of this - the axis.

111
00:10:16,879 --> 00:10:20,259
This is the axis. The axis price at the top - not the wick.

112
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:31,659
This is the measurement criterion - eight. Eight components you need to remember. Gotta remember or understand them.

113
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:43,100
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight - about that many. Put them together, it'll look something like this.

114
00:10:43,679 --> 00:10:52,259
Combined, we still count only the body. This one doesn't count. This one passes. Because this one doesn't reach half.

115
00:10:52,259 --> 00:10:55,960
Half stops around here. See? It's lower - doesn't count.

116
00:10:55,960 --> 00:11:03,139
The ones that don't count mean the power of that candlestick, whether on the Action or Reaction side...

117
00:11:03,139 --> 00:11:08,120
Remember which side is which? Action, Reaction, Reaction, Reaction.

118
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:12,120
It's already absorbed by the axis. It's lower, doesn't stick out.

119
00:11:12,759 --> 00:11:15,419
Means the axis absorbed it. If this is the selling side, right?

120
00:11:15,419 --> 00:11:19,220
Price came down more than half like this. The price that came down...

121
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:36,159
It's already absorbed inside here. And then it bounces back up.

122
00:11:36,159 --> 00:11:39,000
The price - it's still absorbed coming out. What do we call it?

123
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:45,080
Yeah, it won't all come out. Like this one doesn't count. But if it sticks out...

124
00:11:45,399 --> 00:11:48,080
Breaks through and comes out already - yeah, like this - it counts.

125
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:51,740
Kind of like a magnet field, you know? Count the lowest price point and all that.

126
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:57,240
Eight things. Remember them all? Eight things. Alright, now back to this.

127
00:11:57,659 --> 00:12:02,440
So besides remembering those 8 things, we're gonna go back once more to this diagram.

128
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:04,620
There are 3 patterns. See it yet?

129
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:09,340
Wait, wait - let me erase first.

130
00:12:15,559 --> 00:12:20,580
Like this - what I'm about to explain.

131
00:12:21,139 --> 00:12:28,360
Like this. If we see this pattern, it means price is running down and up.

132
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:31,480
Going up, right? So yeah, it goes up.

133
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,539
But it won't go up strongly. I'm saying "not going up strongly."

134
00:12:36,539 --> 00:12:44,820
That means the Action side has more force than the Reaction side.

135
00:12:46,259 --> 00:12:47,960
You ask, "More like this?" Well, it doesn't exceed it.

136
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:50,440
It can't overcome it.

137
00:12:52,879 --> 00:12:56,320
This side is selling pressure - pushing down continuously.

138
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:59,320
Hits this point and goes up - the price goes up as Reaction.

139
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:02,919
But the next one that should confirm the force of the center axis...

140
00:13:02,919 --> 00:13:05,840
Turns back, can't beat this side.

141
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:08,220
That means the force is weaker.

142
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:11,080
So this Reaction side loses.

143
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:16,179
When it loses, it doesn't have enough force to go far up.

144
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:23,399
So it'll only go up a little. As for this one - it's relatively...

145
00:13:23,399 --> 00:13:27,679
Balanced - goes up too. Honestly, we can say it goes up stronger.

146
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:31,759
Than this one. And this one definitely goes up the strongest.

147
00:13:32,659 --> 00:13:38,179
More than this and more than this. Because the Reaction side WINS.

148
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:48,259
Yeah, Action hits support/resistance - bounces back up higher than before.

149
00:13:48,539 --> 00:13:52,340
Wins like this. There might be other candlesticks here - we don't care.

150
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:56,440
We just want the candlesticks in the set we need, that's all.

151
00:13:56,440 --> 00:14:00,899
We want the balance scale to measure the power. Got it?

152
00:14:00,899 --> 00:14:04,500
If we use this, ultimately it becomes these 3 patterns.

153
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:07,860
Weak force - this is weak force.

154
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:15,080
Evenly matched - balanced - relatively evenly matched. And finally wins - force is much stronger.

155
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:16,980
Reaction side - force is much stronger.

156
00:14:18,379 --> 00:14:22,759
Simple balance scale - there are only 3 patterns. That's it - equal.

157
00:14:26,519 --> 00:14:28,220
Action side is stronger.

158
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:38,399
Reaction side force is much stronger, heavier. That's all there is - nothing more than this.

159
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:43,039
Now you ask, "How do we start using this?" Once we know this, how do we apply it, right?

160
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:45,620
Let's look at that.

161
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:53,899
When using it - use it like this.

162
00:14:57,080 --> 00:15:02,980
Say we look at this diagram. This one, alright? We're trading and we see price running like this.

163
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:10,580
Action, got it? Action, Reaction going up.

164
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:23,240
We're gonna buy. If you learned Momentum from Season 1...

165
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:23,659
You would...

166
00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:28,639
Some people already got to buy inside the candlestick wick - got a good price.

167
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:35,200
But this one here - this section is what we call the SAFEST entry point.

168
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:39,039
You might have to wait. Instead of getting in right here, you might have to wait - wait for this candlestick.

169
00:15:39,419 --> 00:15:42,899
We wait for all 3 to complete first - there's the center axis, there's the arm, there's the arm.

170
00:15:43,639 --> 00:15:47,519
When it confirms it's gonna continue - wait, not continue - it's gonna reverse like this.

171
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:52,679
We can enter on the next one. Enter on the fourth candlestick, and we open...

172
00:15:52,679 --> 00:15:56,700
The price to continue. But it's kind of... see?

173
00:15:56,700 --> 00:16:00,480
When it confirms, it won't - it won't - yeah, it won't.

174
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:09,259
So when we enter, let it run until it hits support/resistance and sees another set on the opposite side.

175
00:16:09,259 --> 00:16:17,419
Like Action-Reaction again. That's it. Place Stop Loss below the low price here. This is how we use it.

176
00:16:19,019 --> 00:16:24,519
I'll explain the theory first - then we'll go into real charts and you'll understand better.

177
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:36,700
Or if there's a lot here - same amount or more than here - it gets broken and fails - price might not continue.

178
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:46,320
It becomes a reversal period coming down like this too. Because remember, when price runs, it has to run like this - remember?

179
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:55,000
And this - there'll be sideways when patterns haven't formed yet. Can't tell at all if this is sideways or not.

180
00:16:55,460 --> 00:17:03,620
Why? It could become a reversal point like this already. But if it's sideways, it continues to this one.

181
00:17:04,359 --> 00:17:10,119
Then hits the real peak, and changes direction to downtrend - continues down.

182
00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:13,759
The chart talks like this. And here - it comes to this new side.

183
00:17:13,759 --> 00:17:19,599
It's measuring the cycle of this, cycling on and on, cycling continuously.

184
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:22,940
So look at this point - it's the same thing.

185
00:17:22,940 --> 00:17:40,099
Yeah, this spot doesn't have enough force. It becomes sideways right here.

186
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,200
Now we're getting into practical application.

187
00:17:44,039 --> 00:17:47,500
Let's check out the next episode. We'll get into practical use - how to actually apply it.

188
00:17:48,359 --> 00:17:52,920
We've covered all the theory now. Next step is practical application.
