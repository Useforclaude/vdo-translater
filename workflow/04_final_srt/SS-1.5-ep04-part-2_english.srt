1
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:10,000
Now we've reached the next topic, the next episode, which is about Sideways markets.

2
00:00:10,519 --> 00:00:18,000
Normally price goes up like this, then it consolidates like this, then continues, then changes to go down.

3
00:00:18,539 --> 00:00:21,839
The cycle will be something like this.

4
00:00:22,039 --> 00:00:26,079
Before this, we already learned about reversals.

5
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:30,359
Those points there are reversal points.

6
00:00:30,699 --> 00:00:35,179
Now we're going to learn about Sideways, this period here.

7
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:40,439
During Sideways, will it go up? Or from Sideways will it go down?

8
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:42,619
It can change either way.

9
00:00:43,060 --> 00:00:48,859
It's not that if it's Sideways and it's in an uptrend, it must continue up. It could go down too.

10
00:00:49,259 --> 00:00:55,579
Now let's look at how we analyze candlesticks, the conditions of the balance scale.

11
00:00:55,579 --> 00:00:59,579
The price balance scale, Action and Reaction, how does it work?

12
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:02,179
Let me erase this first.

13
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:09,879
Now let's look at the easy analysis of Action Reaction in Sideways markets.

14
00:01:10,299 --> 00:01:16,640
Before this, here was an uptrend coming up like this, which we already looked at.

15
00:01:17,319 --> 00:01:20,579
This part is different, it's a different chart from yesterday.

16
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:27,920
Now we're going to look at the part where it went up and then consolidated Sideways. What happens next after Sideways?

17
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:29,420
Let's take a look.

18
00:01:29,739 --> 00:01:37,319
Right now I've drawn the support level approximately at these points here, understanding that support is an area.

19
00:01:37,319 --> 00:01:40,000
It's an area, not a single thin line.

20
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:43,459
Not a single line like this, support can't be like that.

21
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:47,819
It has to be an area, a range.

22
00:01:48,659 --> 00:01:53,439
Check here, it held and didn't go down. Here it was resisted.

23
00:01:54,079 --> 00:02:01,180
So this is an area that has density or is like a wall of price that blocks it.

24
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:06,099
Or it's like a barrier, as we've learned, that it can't pass through yet.

25
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:10,900
Because once it passes through, it will continue like this.

26
00:02:11,439 --> 00:02:16,080
Now let's say we don't know about this part yet, that it's going to be Sideways.

27
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:19,639
Let's look. Now we'll get the axis.

28
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:22,439
The balance scale axis, here it is.

29
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,560
The balance scale axis is here.

30
00:02:24,979 --> 00:02:27,780
Now what else are we going to look at?

31
00:02:28,259 --> 00:02:33,159
We get the highest price point here, closed at this point.

32
00:02:33,759 --> 00:02:39,360
Then we look at the left side and right side, which is Action and Reaction.

33
00:02:40,379 --> 00:02:43,300
We have the center axis now, right?

34
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:46,460
The center axis of the balance scale, remember?

35
00:02:47,139 --> 00:02:49,240
From the previous lessons, we need to have the center axis first.

36
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:52,680
Then we can measure the force, like this.

37
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:57,039
On this side that's bearish, we get this one.

38
00:02:57,719 --> 00:03:00,039
Draw it here. Does this side exceed half?

39
00:03:00,439 --> 00:03:03,000
Half would be about here.

40
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:07,819
So this exceeds half of the axis.

41
00:03:08,039 --> 00:03:11,860
So does this candle count? Yes, it counts. And is it a lot? Yes, a lot.

42
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:15,479
See how it won going up like this?

43
00:03:15,879 --> 00:03:23,080
So after we see this, it means price has a chance to consolidate, which means pull back down because it's quite strong.

44
00:03:23,479 --> 00:03:25,719
It went way beyond, a lot.

45
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:33,560
Now if we look at it with Momentum from Season 1, see? It had force pushing up to here then contracted back down.

46
00:03:34,099 --> 00:03:35,080
Ending like this.

47
00:03:35,479 --> 00:03:38,340
This is selling pressure, selling pressure pushing down.

48
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:41,539
Very clear, the red side.

49
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:45,039
This candle got hit down, getting ready to reverse.

50
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:50,360
And the next candle opened and followed down again like this.

51
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:02,420
This is the highest point, so we'll count this one.

52
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:23,339
Actually we count this one. Whatever happens, we don't care about other price points.

53
00:05:23,339 --> 00:05:27,360
And then swing up again. This one is the axis. Let's look again and adjust the line.

54
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:29,860
Here, the axis is here.

55
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:33,519
This is Action, this is Reaction.

56
00:05:34,939 --> 00:05:37,740
Very close, but it looks like Reaction loses slightly.

57
00:05:38,379 --> 00:05:42,420
So price can't go lower than this yet.

58
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:47,160
It consolidates further, see? It can't win all at once.

59
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:51,939
This set compared to this set has less, I mean the force is decreasing.

60
00:05:51,939 --> 00:05:55,439
Reaction is decreasing. So this much isn't enough yet.

61
00:05:55,439 --> 00:06:12,399
It can't finish going down in one go. This one is even less.

62
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:18,480
And we need to find the next one, the highest one of the later group that swung up after Sideways.

63
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:22,800
Which one is it? There are many. If finding the highest, it's this one.

64
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:30,600
This line, and stick it at the boundary like before, at the Body.

65
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:37,860
And find the Action Reaction sides. This is Action, see? Right here.

66
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:42,600
Does this side have more? Has more, this one. Still small.

67
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:46,939
Force is still small, not enough yet. Resistance first. See?

68
00:06:46,939 --> 00:06:49,120
This side, evenly matched. So can it go down?

69
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:54,420
Not down yet. Price went up here, came down, still not down.

70
00:06:55,439 --> 00:07:00,819
Up again, up again.

71
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:03,920
Let's find it. These 3, which one is highest? This one.

72
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:09,279
It's this one, then adjust here again. It'll be at its Body.

73
00:07:09,639 --> 00:07:11,639
About here.

74
00:07:12,399 --> 00:07:16,139
So which Action do we get that exceeds half?

75
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:19,000
Exceeds half. Zoom in and look.

76
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:24,459
Here, here.

77
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:28,740
See this?

78
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:32,060
This one exceeds half. Exceeds half, count from the Body.

79
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:35,220
Don't count this one. This one, see how it exceeds half?

80
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:39,500
Here, count placing right here to fit perfectly, perfectly.

81
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,959
Exceeds half here. So count this.

82
00:07:43,959 --> 00:07:49,139
As Action on this side. This side is about here.

83
00:07:49,139 --> 00:07:52,879
And Reaction? This doesn't exceed, see? Doesn't.

84
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:59,319
Here, does it? This is about half, this one. Does it have force yet?

85
00:07:59,899 --> 00:08:02,560
Does this have force? No, no force, no force. This one has force again.

86
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:06,300
See? To push it down. So price ended up running down.

87
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:10,920
Remember that if it gets it, we have to keep counting.

88
00:08:11,439 --> 00:08:17,699
Here, it will run like this. See? Like what we've been doing.

89
00:08:19,839 --> 00:08:28,439
Look, this Low here, it went up here, right? What we just counted is still Low.

90
00:08:28,439 --> 00:08:31,959
And went up here. This is Sideways, see? It's Sideways for a while.

91
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:38,159
And do you see anything? That the old Low is here, and here the Reaction force, this one.

92
00:08:38,519 --> 00:08:43,659
This one wins, so it must be lower than this Low, right? Must be lower. See?

93
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:47,860
In the end it came down lower like this.

94
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,620
This one got it slightly.

95
00:08:52,519 --> 00:08:58,259
See? In the end it broke lower. Won this much.

96
00:08:58,259 --> 00:09:01,379
It doesn't say here wins, then after Sideways it will win this one.

97
00:09:01,559 --> 00:09:04,399
Or come to this one. You have to gradually look step by step.

98
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:08,559
Like this, now this is the latest Low. It will win the latest Low, then come down.

99
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:12,200
Then up again. If you see this as a level already.

100
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:15,240
It becomes resistance, see?

101
00:09:16,899 --> 00:09:19,320
And slide over like this.

102
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:24,279
But now we need to look at its force too.

103
00:09:24,779 --> 00:09:27,539
We've been looking at the force here for a long time.

104
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:33,320
For a long time, this is the very first point where price ran up and we said it must.

105
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:36,759
Here it already told us that price must win this point, so we won't.

106
00:09:36,759 --> 00:09:41,620
Come look at this to find if it must win here. That's a different matter.

107
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:46,259
This one has to win the Low in its own Sideways section, in its own group.

108
00:09:46,259 --> 00:09:47,500
Which is its Low, which is this one here.

109
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:51,120
This is the latest Low. If it wins, it's this one.

110
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:54,320
But this one already said it must come down anyway.

111
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,840
So it's the long-term picture that this one tells. It just might not happen at this time immediately.

112
00:09:57,379 --> 00:09:59,820
But this Sideways, in the end it will have a story.

113
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:02,539
See? It will have a story at each point saying whether it succeeds or not, going on and on.

114
00:10:02,539 --> 00:10:04,799
Until it meets a point where it succeeds.

115
00:10:04,799 --> 00:10:11,480
Measure at this one. Action, put the line here like this.

116
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:24,279
Run up. This is Action. Came down.

117
00:10:24,279 --> 00:10:32,259
Action is about here. Which side is Reaction?

118
00:10:33,679 --> 00:10:38,100
Does this exceed? This one should exceed.

119
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:45,000
We'll count this one. Does it become having force? Does it have force?

120
00:10:45,639 --> 00:10:48,940
No force. Which means it shouldn't pass this.

121
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:53,759
See? It shouldn't pass. But in the end it did pass.

122
00:10:54,659 --> 00:10:57,600
In the end it passed. We already talked about what happens.

123
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:01,320
Something that shouldn't happen, like it shouldn't be possible, but it becomes possible.

124
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:04,620
In the end there must be a reversal of something.

125
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:13,440
Suppose it shouldn't pass, should go down, but it doesn't go down, it continues up.

126
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:17,240
That's it. It will come back down lower than now immediately.

127
00:11:17,879 --> 00:11:21,039
There will be a swing like this, upward swing.

128
00:11:27,659 --> 00:11:33,679
So downward swing is the same. It comes back to swing like this.

129
00:11:33,679 --> 00:11:42,100
Simply put, if it's a downtrend, what must it be like?

130
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:49,559
Must be, um, should go down already, but it comes back up instead, then it becomes like this.

131
00:11:49,559 --> 00:11:54,159
Here, shouldn't pass, but it passed, so in the end it reverses and hits back up.

132
00:11:55,639 --> 00:11:58,980
Wins violently, abnormally. Abnormal like this.

133
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:03,980
Becomes a candle like this, higher than this already.

134
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:07,159
So this one becomes, it's like this one ran up.

135
00:12:07,379 --> 00:12:16,539
Swing here, swing. Swing down, swing up.

136
00:12:17,559 --> 00:12:21,740
So which one do we count? We come back to count this one again, like this.

137
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:25,899
See? Find the line down. This side, now there's nothing on Action side.

138
00:12:25,899 --> 00:12:28,620
No green at all in this Zone. It would have to go far to find this one.

139
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:32,000
Which we won't use, right? We don't count going back that far.

140
00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:35,059
Let's take just about this much. But Reaction came down this much.

141
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:38,919
So it already wins. If going to break, it already exceeds anyway.

142
00:12:38,919 --> 00:12:43,480
It already must break the old Low here anyway.

143
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:49,080
Because just this much already exceeds.

144
00:12:49,259 --> 00:12:55,480
Price swings swings along. In the end it came down.

145
00:12:58,019 --> 00:13:01,200
And this one already said from the start it must reach this one, at least.

146
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:05,519
In the end price came down to here. See?

147
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:19,059
This Low here. If we take, if we take this one, take this one out.

148
00:13:19,059 --> 00:13:23,080
See? It reached here, which is lower. See?

149
00:13:23,399 --> 00:13:25,419
That here is lower than here. It will be from this one, this set that told us.

150
00:13:26,039 --> 00:13:29,399
Price came down to here. Now look at this.

151
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:34,019
And do you think it will go up here again?

152
00:13:34,019 --> 00:13:38,519
Will it be like swing down then swing up, uptrend here?

153
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:41,559
We have to look again. It's not that it went down, hey, wait here.

154
00:13:41,879 --> 00:13:44,519
But actually we got the picture from here already.

155
00:13:44,519 --> 00:13:47,139
Because it must come down about here, which, ah, here actually it already reached.

156
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:51,840
This exceeded already too, maybe. Ah, exceeded, see the tail exceeded.

157
00:13:52,559 --> 00:13:54,799
The tail exceeded already. The tail of this one truly reached here already.

158
00:13:54,799 --> 00:14:00,059
The result of this one, it reached the tail of this one already.

159
00:14:00,059 --> 00:14:04,360
Now once it reached, what happened? It's exactly at support.

160
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:24,779
This one, as soon as price came down, it immediately bounced back up.

161
00:14:24,779 --> 00:14:28,279
It might come back up like this. Right?

162
00:14:28,279 --> 00:14:32,039
It came down to support. The price came down, came to test support from what passed before.

163
00:14:32,039 --> 00:14:37,840
Test. And might reverse back up again.

164
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:54,759
Because here the job was completed successfully already.

165
00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:59,580
The candlestick set, the balance scale that said here, that the Action and, reached here already.

166
00:14:59,580 --> 00:15:05,700
A lot. So there's no way it will go up to this High for sure.

167
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:09,440
It just goes up up up up. In the end got slapped down because it can't go.

168
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:24,740
If reading Momentum it already loses, this set was already losing.

169
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:28,340
It's selling pressure already. This, one, two, three, selling pressure.

170
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,740
Here. Actually it's a line here. It's selling pressure already.

171
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:37,200
In Season 2 style reading the future ahead, you already see that it can't go either.

172
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:43,620
So everything confirms each other, showing that we're confident we won't trade against it.

173
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:47,299
Here it will become a downtrend like this. We don't dare to buy against going up.

174
00:15:49,379 --> 00:15:52,019
Because it can't go far.

175
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:58,299
See? It has, uh, the force here. It came down, it swung came, pa pa pa pa pa.

176
00:15:58,299 --> 00:16:01,299
To here, this is the lowest. Then it came to receive, swing came like this.

177
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:13,600
This is Sideways. It's in a frame.

178
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:23,299
If you look, see? Here here here, it's on the downtrend leg like this.

179
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:26,919
Here, Sideways like this, right?

180
00:16:26,919 --> 00:16:30,039
It's just this thick. Let's see, what? Ah, this is green, this one.

181
00:16:30,039 --> 00:16:33,220
This side is definitely this one, as Action.

182
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:35,860
And then this has to be this one. This one. See?

183
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:50,299
At first it was this one. Now it's like this, feels like even worse than before.

184
00:16:50,299 --> 00:16:55,080
Like the force is decreasing even more.

185
00:16:57,379 --> 00:17:05,700
Can't fight, just barely win. The previous High is definitely this one.

186
00:17:06,619 --> 00:17:15,240
Price has no way to come up to this one. Count this one as Action.

187
00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:21,680
This one is Reaction. The force isn't enough.

188
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:24,160
So when it bounced up here, it can't reach here.

189
00:17:24,519 --> 00:17:30,380
It might come up to about here first.

190
00:17:35,099 --> 00:17:42,980
If it will win here, we already learned that it must do, do what?

191
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:51,299
Something like this, which is make, refresh the force like this.

192
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:53,539
Here the force isn't enough for it to go up to win here.

193
00:17:54,079 --> 00:17:58,740
It might have to wait another bit where here there's more force.

194
00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:01,059
Win here and go up, like this.

195
00:18:03,799 --> 00:18:09,299
Then chase up like this again. Which is have to look at Action Reaction points.

196
00:18:11,779 --> 00:18:13,079
Chase step by step up to where it will be able to win.

197
00:18:15,839 --> 00:18:19,000
Here it doesn't win in the near future.

198
00:18:19,799 --> 00:18:24,940
Came up, scroll down to see. It's here right?

199
00:18:25,099 --> 00:18:28,660
Swing up then down. Wait, will there be a higher point than this?

200
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:32,339
Found a point higher than this, because this point is, it swung like this, might come to this point.

201
00:18:32,339 --> 00:18:48,980
Right? Is there a higher one? Going forward it chased up already.

202
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:54,819
So now not this point, it must come up to about here.

203
00:18:54,819 --> 00:18:57,640
So it will be this shape. Like price came down like this.

204
00:18:58,779 --> 00:19:02,019
Not quite lined up. We have to come here. Like take this, and come here.

205
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:07,519
The swing will be like this. So now we'll look.

206
00:19:07,519 --> 00:19:13,619
Suppose it's a swing, erase this first. This one.

207
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:16,940
The axis comes to here. This is here. This can be used.

208
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:22,519
So this one has force. It will chase up. Have force.

209
00:19:22,519 --> 00:19:26,240
Then will win this. Because this one if receiving the original.

210
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,000
The area around here, it already won. This is the latest one.

211
00:19:32,339 --> 00:19:40,440
It might be this one. Go up to this, this one. Will it go down?

212
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:46,500
Scroll and see. Showing that it still goes up.

213
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:52,640
Not finished yet. Follow it first. Follow it.

214
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:56,180
Now count this as the axis. Because it went up to here.

215
00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:02,839
Because it hasn't won this one yet, but already won here successfully.

216
00:20:02,839 --> 00:20:07,700
Now here. We'll look again at how far down it will go.

217
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:09,640
Does it have force to go down? Here is the axis.

218
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:16,460
This definitely counts. Does this exceed half? About half.

219
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:20,700
About half. Wait for confirmation. Doesn't have, so this one is half.

220
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:25,140
Actually it's half. So maybe count this one.

221
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:46,440
Asking if there's force down? If suppose we count this one, it loses.

222
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:52,200
Here is the axis. Here. Loses. I mean here.

223
00:20:52,759 --> 00:20:57,000
Here. Loses. So will it be able to come down to this Low or this one?

224
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:02,680
Not likely that it will go down. So it might go up again.

225
00:21:03,079 --> 00:21:08,700
Wait because it, it doesn't have force to press down to reach this area.

226
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:13,000
See? It just chases up and this, will it go down? It just slaps slaps slaps up again.

227
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:16,079
Becomes new. This one went up, down up. So it will become, change to count this one.

228
00:21:16,079 --> 00:21:19,880
Now let's look at this one. Not this one. This one must be the axis.

229
00:21:20,299 --> 00:21:38,720
This one must be the axis. As a new axis. But because after this one ran and came here.

230
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:42,460
And went up here. This one will become the axis. This one, stick at the axis.

231
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:46,039
Stick the line. Stick it. Then we find what? Uh, Action Reaction. Get which one?

232
00:21:46,039 --> 00:21:51,059
This one doesn't get it. This one gets it right away. This one gets it.

233
00:21:51,359 --> 00:21:54,660
Here. Make this one clear. Once this one gets it.

234
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:59,839
We'll see that between this one and this one, this one has more force.

235
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:03,640
And when comparing sets, compare sets.

236
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:09,900
Between this one and this set. This set has less force. This set switches sides.

237
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:24,640
Like the balance scale changed. It changed, showing force increased.

238
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:54,619
So it will have more force to go down than before. But this one didn't go down much.

239
00:22:54,619 --> 00:22:57,700
It bounced back up to make swing number one. While it's Sideways.

240
00:22:58,019 --> 00:23:01,859
This has a chance to come down. Come down further. Force is quite a lot more.

241
00:23:01,859 --> 00:23:07,259
Because this one is very small. Came back down a lot. If reading.

242
00:23:07,259 --> 00:23:11,960
Reading about bringing Momentum in, or energy in, or measuring force. Got it.

243
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:14,519
There's a chance to come down more than before. More than before.

244
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:28,000
And bring other things in as well. Support and resistance.

245
00:23:28,519 --> 00:23:30,799
Forgot that we already learned from theory. It's not that we look at only one thing.

246
00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:34,799
The balance scale, you must look at where it happens. The components must be complete.

247
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:40,339
Remember? Now where will it be complete? Here. Is it an important level?

248
00:23:41,619 --> 00:23:44,319
Is it resistance? It's resistance. And it's a trendline here.

249
00:23:44,319 --> 00:23:47,460
Very likely, not likely, it's an important position already. It's an important scene.

250
00:23:48,279 --> 00:23:49,799
If we read cartoon style, it's an important scene already. The cast is complete.

251
00:23:49,799 --> 00:23:53,779
It switched from less force to come up, has less force. Can't go down yet.

252
00:23:53,779 --> 00:23:57,359
But came to resistance area, the same. So this time it comes, it still won't go down yet.

253
00:23:57,900 --> 00:24:00,940
It goes on. Close to each other already. Around the resistance area like this.

254
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:05,460
That day there's a chance to come down. Normally from Price Action, it also...

255
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:12,259
This resistance. If it's Sideways down, right? It must come.

256
00:24:13,079 --> 00:24:17,420
Next receive is receive here. Or receive at the horizontal level.

257
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:22,380
Whichever. Now we'll look. Gradually came down. Because its force is more, see?

258
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:25,980
Here is the swing of bouncing back. Will it bounce back past this resistance?

259
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:35,440
Hey, will it bounce back? Wow. Like about half a bit.

260
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:40,039
This one definitely gets this candle as Action. We, Reaction must be this one.

261
00:24:40,039 --> 00:24:45,579
Wait. Finished this. Here. Do you see? Action Reaction.

262
00:24:45,579 --> 00:24:52,220
Will it go lower than this? Went down first. Can't go down.

263
00:24:53,799 --> 00:24:57,960
In the end this one has more influence. Because this one can't overturn or break through.

264
00:24:57,960 --> 00:25:03,000
It went up like this, that's it, won this High. This old High that's bigger that covered from the start.

265
00:25:04,019 --> 00:25:08,660
BREAK this out. See? This is how we read it.

266
00:25:11,579 --> 00:25:19,240
Should understand more now. Should understand more about the method of reading.

267
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,000
About this. The method of reading is like this. That is.

268
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:28,740
Read Sideways, read when reversing we already read. This is reading during the way.

269
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:32,940
Sideways, whether it will continue or Sideways then slap down.

270
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:36,559
If here it shows signals slap down. If suppose this candle Action Reaction is like this.

271
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:41,759
Price also has a chance to slap down. But it's not, because it shows that.

272
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:47,460
It goes the same direction, you see? This says pass. This says don't pass.

273
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:51,259
Which is this says up, up a lot. This says down little. Correct. It tells correctly.

274
00:25:51,660 --> 00:25:55,619
But if this says up a lot, this says down a lot. Hey, they contradict each other.

275
00:25:55,619 --> 00:26:00,079
See? Clear signals contradict each other. But this one doesn't contradict.

276
00:26:00,079 --> 00:26:05,019
It goes the same direction. This says up. This says down little.

277
00:26:05,019 --> 00:26:09,779
It does come down a little bit, around the sides. And around this level area.

278
00:26:09,779 --> 00:26:14,319
Anyone would have a chance to see it as sell down. Because this is all resistance.

279
00:26:14,319 --> 00:26:18,039
See? Resistance of the trendline. Resistance of the line. Resistance here.

280
00:26:19,660 --> 00:26:30,059
And got a long pinbar coming down closing red like this too.

281
00:26:30,299 --> 00:26:35,500
And Sideways on the side. Slowing down like this.

282
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:42,039
Momentum going up very little. If looking as Momentum, small small short candles.

283
00:26:42,259 --> 00:27:00,039
Anyone would look sell, slap down. But Action Reaction says it should go up.

284
00:27:00,039 --> 00:27:04,579
It becomes like this. So we understand. About this.

285
00:27:04,579 --> 00:27:08,259
Should be able to apply and use now. Like special episode.

286
00:27:08,559 --> 00:27:12,779
Special image. This special image ends at this episode like this.

287
00:27:12,779 --> 00:27:17,660
Ends at about this much. Which is got more tricks. If calling it tricks.

288
00:27:18,619 --> 00:27:22,099
Additional tricks that you can bring to use in trading next.

289
00:27:22,099 --> 00:27:25,460
Practice. Which is practice then collect experience.

290
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:30,839
See that normally the candles we see. Candle candle candle candle like this.

291
00:27:31,019 --> 00:27:47,640
There are many things hidden inside. Did you ever notice and look for them and find them?

292
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:50,480
That's all. Whoever got to the end, congratulations.

293
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:52,720
Considered that just your learning just this much is, came out, whoever didn't come out.

294
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:55,339
But learned all 3 ways already. You must go back and review.

295
00:27:55,339 --> 00:27:59,000
It's up to you. You'll get additional weapons here. See?

296
00:27:59,359 --> 00:28:01,559
This. And even more, whoever got to learn young news too.

297
00:28:01,559 --> 00:28:03,240
Congratulations, you almost have everything complete. Others they also see the chart, candles like this.

298
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:07,720
But they don't see like this. See what's hidden. But you see.

299
00:28:07,980 --> 00:28:12,640
Bring it to apply. Everyone good luck.

301
00:28:13,079 --> 00:28:22,500
Move back to the original first. At this one. This one bounced up here. Where did this bounce down? Is there lower? This one is lower.

302
00:28:24,140 --> 00:28:29,079
Then move here. See? Move here. The axis follows like this.

303
00:28:31,579 --> 00:28:35,039
We get Action on this side. Action. As for Reaction, this one is balanced.

304
00:28:35,039 --> 00:28:42,279
This green might not get it yet. Ah, really doesn't get it. Doesn't have. Oh have, have, have.

305
00:28:42,279 --> 00:28:46,500
Have this one. See? This one. It closed like, this thin one. Move a bit.

306
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:59,059
A bit. Here. But it closed like this. This place it closed. It exceeds this one.

307
00:28:59,980 --> 00:29:04,980
See? In the end it went down. Came down here.

308
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:10,420
Came down then bounced up. So around this area. And which one is it?

309
00:29:10,420 --> 00:29:14,900
You find which one is lowest. Which looking already it should be.

310
00:29:15,779 --> 00:29:22,480
All very close. Probably the green one.

311
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:28,160
Take the green one. Here. Action. Reaction. Find it now.

312
00:29:28,420 --> 00:29:37,700
Which one? See. Exceed half or not? If exceed half, count.

313
00:29:37,940 --> 00:29:42,220
Balanced. If exceed half or not? Count.

314
00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:46,279
But it's balanced. You're not sure, then consider the force evenly matched.

315
00:29:46,279 --> 00:29:50,440
Suppose count just these two. Consider very evenly matched.

316
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:51,940
But if count next one. Let's see. Don't clear this one.

317
00:29:54,420 --> 00:29:55,579
Suppose doesn't exceed half, must count this candle green. This one not clear.

318
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:56,819
Must count this candle. Evenly matched anyway.

319
00:29:56,819 --> 00:29:58,539
Or here actually exceeds half already. Can't count this candle. Must count this candle. Loses.

320
00:29:58,539 --> 00:30:00,859
Loses. Must do balance again. Wait for them to do balance first.

321
00:30:00,859 --> 00:30:01,539
They go up up. See? When they go up, they still haven't won the old swing.

322
00:30:01,859 --> 00:30:02,339
Uh, old High. Because here the force says isn't enough.

323
00:30:02,339 --> 00:30:03,319
Close to evenly matched. If count here with here, which is evenly matched.

324
00:30:03,319 --> 00:30:04,799
Move up a bit, still doesn't get it. Here if it bounces down.

325
00:30:05,180 --> 00:30:06,400
We'll count this one down. Um, down bounced swing came like this.

326
00:30:06,660 --> 00:30:08,140
Look at Action and Reaction again. But suppose it wins.

327
00:30:08,980 --> 00:30:11,160
Suppose it goes up, it wins. What abnormal will happen?

328
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:14,720
It will fall down violently anyway. This one doesn't exceed half.

329
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:18,880
This candle doesn't count. And must count Action this one.

330
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:22,900
Air Action see already. This one. Loses or not? Loses. Force enough to come down to win this one or not?

331
00:30:23,099 --> 00:30:25,880
Not enough. So it still won't go down. It has no way to be lower than.

332
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:32,319
Whether opportunity better, not really. Not really. Means no way.

333
00:30:35,099 --> 00:30:37,539
Opportunity for it to be lower than here is small.

334
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:41,539
Comparing to old Low, Low ahead is small. So shouldn't be lower than this.

335
00:30:42,339 --> 00:30:47,440
So can it bounce down? Bounce down. This must bounce down for sure.

336
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:50,720
Because here it, it went down. But Reaction it loses. Action.

337
00:30:51,099 --> 00:30:56,019
It might come down to about here. Scroll scroll go. But still no higher.

338
00:30:56,019 --> 00:30:59,740
So it's this swing for sure. Might come down to here.

339
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:02,539
Go up here. See? It still hasn't come down to win here.

340
00:31:02,539 --> 00:31:06,119
This. Because this one won. This is, uh, this is.

341
00:31:06,119 --> 00:31:10,180
Here see? The balance scale tilts like this. This won. Still wins. Wins.

342
00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:15,259
I mean not reached. See? Not reached. Still not reached.

343
00:31:15,259 --> 00:31:18,460
But asking why it went down. Uh, earlier we didn't look.

344
00:31:18,799 --> 00:31:22,059
It swung to here. And swung up, highest of this one, which one.

345
00:31:23,180 --> 00:31:25,400
Which is this red one. That one then moved like this.

346
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:30,759
Wow. Got it. This green. This one doesn't get it. This one doesn't get it. This one gets it.

347
00:31:31,059 --> 00:31:35,440
This. This is Action. This is Action already, this one.

348
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:39,700
This Action. Which is the other Reaction? This doesn't exceed.

349
00:31:40,099 --> 00:31:47,039
It's very balanced, this one. Come draw line right here.

350
00:31:48,619 --> 00:31:52,980
So the green one floats exceeds up. The float floats lower down than here.

351
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:57,200
Count this one. This one hard. Scroll come this then still doesn't exceed half.

352
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:02,799
That day count this one. Dark a lot. More a lot.

353
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:13,000
Then won the old Low which is this Low. Which is this short short Low just this much.

354
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:18,519
Not this Low. That. Just this Low just that much. Then won, came down.

355
00:32:20,420 --> 00:32:23,700
So this one bounced back up. Swing then changed.

356
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:27,779
Swing changed like this. Like this. Got it. This lump.

357
00:32:27,779 --> 00:32:30,220
This candle got it. It will be, uh, be like, this one. Have or not?

358
00:32:30,220 --> 00:32:33,539
This still doesn't have at all. Still doesn't have any increase.

359
00:32:34,839 --> 00:32:39,000
We must scroll until find the one that got it. This. Exceed half.

360
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:49,940
Body exceed half. But it's close, evenly matched.

361
00:32:49,940 --> 00:32:54,779
So should, continue. Still not won this one. Which is, this High like.

362
00:32:54,779 --> 00:32:58,180
No lower than this, we then move to count here.

363
00:33:00,180 --> 00:33:07,900
So it swung up already. And came down here, count here.

364
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:14,140
Adjust come down. This. Red. This still not half.

365
00:33:14,140 --> 00:33:17,599
This still not half. See. Came over not to half. Can't count this candle.

366
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:24,980
After this doesn't have. That exceeds half it will have just this one. This.

367
00:33:24,980 --> 00:33:37,880
Which is far. Sometimes we won't count. We'll consider this side doesn't have Reaction already.

368
00:33:38,859 --> 00:33:44,460
Come look green side. This one got it, see? Dark at this, here.

369
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:51,059
The Action balance scale other side here, but this side doesn't have. Doesn't have Action.

370
00:33:51,460 --> 00:33:53,700
But have Reaction. So price has tendency. From this swing.

371
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:57,220
That will climb up higher than this High. Higher than this High.

372
00:33:57,220 --> 00:34:00,640
Then going along. Wow. Higher or not? Oops. Dud dud dud. Still not reached.

373
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:03,460
Go down or not? Still not down. Uh, Sideways continue.

374
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:04,839
Actually almost count this one already. Uh, wait for confirmation candle.

375
00:34:07,579 --> 00:34:08,860
Then use something to confirm continuously. Oh wait for swing.

376
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:11,480
Wow. Actually it's, this. Went up and came down.

377
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:14,820
But it's considered this is all Sideways set. It still doesn't look like clear waves yet.

378
00:34:15,239 --> 00:34:17,059
See? Here. Then go. Go. Ah, went down already. Ah, still not won. See?

379
00:34:17,059 --> 00:34:19,579
This High is still lower. Uh, came down. But this one says have force.

380
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:22,219
It should go up. Hmm. It bounced down.

381
00:34:23,059 --> 00:34:23,980
But it shouldn't be lower than this already. Because this one has force.

382
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:25,059
It still doesn't have anything that would say to slap down lower than this.

383
00:34:27,099 --> 00:34:27,880
The set above here already. Uh, wait see if it will bounce or not.

384
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:30,159
Uh, this. Here. Low is here. Doesn't go lower. This. Still not reached. See?

385
00:34:31,820 --> 00:34:32,739
But this already went up. So I'll change this set to here.

386
00:34:33,239 --> 00:34:34,079
Then here is the balance scale axis. The axis is here.

387
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:36,099
This one exceeds or not? Exceeds half. Exceeds. Exceeds already. Clear, this exceeds half for sure.

388
00:34:36,719 --> 00:34:38,260
This red one. Green. Exceeds or not? Exceeds half or not?

389
00:34:38,260 --> 00:34:39,679
Exceeds already. You see force exceeds what up. Action Reaction Action High.

390
00:34:39,900 --> 00:34:42,460
The old is here. Latest High. And this one.

391
00:34:43,099 --> 00:34:44,539
But you see the force is different. Compare this set with this set.

392
00:34:47,179 --> 00:34:47,659
Or this set that became swing before. See? This loses, can't go up to exceed this.

393
00:34:47,659 --> 00:34:50,260
This doesn't have force. This one. Here. Count here. Count here.

394
00:34:50,260 --> 00:34:52,260
Green here. Close. Uh, in summary. Less force. Less force and it has a lot of force here.

395
00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:54,679
So what must happen? Less less lot. Remember head and shoulder at all?

396
00:34:54,679 --> 00:34:55,860
Less, so it doesn't pass. Less doesn't pass. Finally third time lot, then broke through up.

397
00:34:57,039 --> 00:34:58,119
So there's tendency that price. Sideways is. If draw frame it will be like, similar to triangle like this.

398
00:34:58,119 --> 00:34:59,739
See? Low raise higher. Higher. Have chance Break triangle up to upper side this side.

399
00:35:00,199 --> 00:35:02,960
Go up after it consolidated for a while. This one we can enter buy.

400
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:04,000
Then if going let it run long up. It won. High this for sure.

401
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,880
From past already it broke triangle. If this one is triangle really.

402
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:08,320
We look at Pattern, it must continue at least.

403
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:10,880
About the distance of about here. At least must have about this distance.

404
00:35:11,559 --> 00:35:15,119
But it only came to here, the lowest point, then it didn't come down to lower zone.

405
00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:16,420
Half of the downward leg. It also has a chance already. In Momentum it also says will raise up.

406
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:25,480
This reads one way. Um, bring to enhance, this, see? Then I also read Momentum go.

407
00:35:25,679 --> 00:35:26,039
But it's not reading Momentum how. Then I'll see already.

408
00:35:27,639 --> 00:35:29,579
Set this. Set this. Set this. Until at this set.

409
00:35:30,599 --> 00:35:33,039
And the force of this set increased. So there's a chance price will jump up.

410
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:37,139
Also high at this point already. Um, came to see. Went up. Um, see?

411
00:35:39,559 --> 00:35:41,219
It must win High first. Which it also won successfully already. From this point.

412
00:35:41,380 --> 00:35:43,920
Have force. This is what happened. Do you see the traces of price or not?

413
00:35:44,519 --> 00:35:48,360
That it tells us. Not that it doesn't tell us at all. It tells very clearly.

414
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:52,079
You just need to find the traces to find them. If you read Momentum.

415
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:56,480
Some you read Momentum may be from short one candle.

416
00:35:56,659 --> 00:35:56,820
Um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um.

417
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:06,440
Here here here this is resistance. And broke through the resistance, see?

418
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:10,860
Anyone would look down. At this time. Um, must come down to line. This. Must come down.

419
00:36:11,239 --> 00:36:17,800
Maybe come to trendline below this? Or come resistance here.

420
00:36:19,780 --> 00:36:26,219
But we read what? Earlier we read what? Action Reaction helps.

421
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:31,420
Um, the part here it says it must pass. Must go up. Force increased.

422
00:36:31,420 --> 00:36:34,699
Suppose it met this one again. Hey, measure. You measure.

423
00:36:40,079 --> 00:36:43,340
Hey, this one. This is the axis. Here. So you'll get this one.

424
00:36:43,340 --> 00:36:45,900
Here is Action for sure. Exceed half already. This. This Action.

425
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:48,920
And Reaction. Must be this one. Wait. Finished this. This. See?

426
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:51,440
Action Reaction. Will it go lower than this? Went down first. Can't go down.

427
00:36:52,039 --> 00:36:55,599
In the end this one has more influence. Because this one can't overturn or break through.

428
00:36:55,599 --> 00:36:58,599
It went up like this, that's it. Won this High. This old High that's bigger that covered from the start.

429
00:36:58,599 --> 00:37:13,320
BREAK this out. See? This is how we read it.

430
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:17,420
Should understand more now. Should understand more about the method of reading.

431
00:37:17,420 --> 00:37:22,480
About this. The method of reading is like this. That is.

432
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:25,719
Read Sideways, read when reversing we already read. This is reading during the way.

433
00:37:25,719 --> 00:37:43,300
Sideways, whether it will continue or Sideways then slap down.

434
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:47,159
If here it shows signals slap down. If suppose this candle Action Reaction is like this.

435
00:37:47,159 --> 00:37:51,940
Price also has a chance to slap down. But it's not, because it shows that.

436
00:37:51,940 --> 00:37:56,119
It goes the same direction, you see? This says pass. This says don't pass.

437
00:37:56,119 --> 00:38:01,019
Which is this says up, up a lot. This says down little. Correct. It tells correctly.

438
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:07,440
But if this says up a lot, this says down a lot. Hey, they contradict each other.

439
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:10,960
See? Clear signals contradict each other. But this one doesn't contradict.

440
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:15,460
It goes the same direction. This says up. This says down little.

441
00:38:16,380 --> 00:38:21,280
It does come down a little bit, around the sides. And around this level area.

442
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:31,000
Anyone would have a chance to see it as sell down. Because this is all resistance.

443
00:38:31,340 --> 00:38:35,480
See? Resistance of the trendline. Resistance of the line. Resistance here.

444
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:38,000
And got a long pinbar coming down closing red like this too.

445
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:41,699
And Sideways on the side. Slowing down like this.

446
00:38:41,699 --> 00:38:45,000
Momentum going up very little. If looking as Momentum, small small short candles.

447
00:38:45,000 --> 00:39:00,980
Anyone would look sell, slap down. But Action Reaction says it should go up.

448
00:39:00,980 --> 00:39:27,679
It becomes like this. So we understand. About this.

449
00:39:27,679 --> 00:39:30,400
Should be able to apply and use now. Like special episode.

450
00:39:31,900 --> 00:39:34,099
Special image. This special image ends at this episode like this.

451
00:39:35,199 --> 00:39:38,699
Ends at about this much. Which is got more tricks. If calling it tricks.

452
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:44,099
Additional tricks that you can bring to use in trading next.

453
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:49,400
Practice. Which is practice then collect experience.

454
00:39:49,820 --> 00:39:52,940
See that normally the candles we see. Candle candle candle candle like this.

455
00:39:53,159 --> 00:39:55,559
There are many things hidden inside. Did you ever notice and look for them and find them?

456
00:39:55,559 --> 00:39:58,199
That's all. Whoever got to the end, congratulations.

457
00:39:58,199 --> 00:40:02,980
Considered that just your learning just this much is, came out.

458
00:40:03,199 --> 00:40:05,659
Whoever didn't come out but learned all 3 ways already.

459
00:40:05,659 --> 00:40:09,780
You must go back and review. It's up to you.

460
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:21,000
You'll get additional weapons here. See? This.

461
00:40:21,559 --> 00:40:26,340
And even more, whoever got to learn Season 2 too.

462
00:40:27,079 --> 00:40:31,539
Congratulations, you almost have everything complete.

463
00:40:32,079 --> 00:40:37,559
Others they also see the chart, candles like this.

464
00:40:38,300 --> 00:40:43,260
But they don't see like this. See what's hidden. But you see.

465
00:40:43,940 --> 00:40:49,119
Bring it to apply. Everyone good luck.

466
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:54,420
About this. The method of reading is like this. Like read Sideways.

467
00:40:54,920 --> 00:41:00,559
Read when reversing we already read. This is reading during the way, Sideways, whether it will continue or.

468
00:41:00,559 --> 00:41:08,420
Sideways then slap down. If here it shows signals slap down. If suppose this candle Action Reaction is like this.

469
00:41:10,860 --> 00:41:18,000
Price also has a chance to slap down. But it's not, because it shows that it goes the same direction.

470
00:41:19,059 --> 00:41:25,900
This says pass. This says don't pass. Which is this says up, up a lot. This says down little. Correct.

471
00:41:26,340 --> 00:41:31,400
It tells correctly. But if this says up a lot, this says down a lot. Hey, they contradict each other.

472
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:36,360
See? Clear signals contradict each other. But this one doesn't contradict.

473
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:42,139
It goes the same direction. This says up. This says down little.

474
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:47,179
It does come down a little bit, around the sides. And around this level area.

475
00:41:47,179 --> 00:41:48,900
Anyone would have a chance to see it as sell down. Because this is all resistance.

476
00:41:49,579 --> 00:41:52,639
See? Resistance of the trendline. Resistance of the line. Resistance here.

477
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:56,460
And got a long pinbar coming down closing red like this too.

478
00:41:58,380 --> 00:42:02,460
And Sideways on the side. Slowing down like this.

479
00:42:02,460 --> 00:42:06,519
Momentum going up very little. If looking as Momentum, small small short candles.

480
00:42:08,659 --> 00:42:13,440
Anyone would look sell, slap down. But Action Reaction says it should go up.

481
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:19,420
It becomes like this. So we understand now. About this.

482
00:42:19,619 --> 00:42:27,000
Should be able to apply and use. Like this special episode.

483
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:31,079
Special demonstration. This special episode ends here.

484
00:42:31,079 --> 00:42:35,420
Ends about this much. Got more techniques. If calling them techniques.

485
00:42:35,420 --> 00:42:40,619
Additional techniques that you can bring to use in trading next.

486
00:42:40,619 --> 00:42:44,659
Practice. Practice and collect experience.

487
00:42:44,659 --> 00:42:48,119
See that normally the candles we see. Candle candle candle like this.

488
00:42:48,119 --> 00:43:05,400
There are many things hidden inside. Did you ever notice and look for them?

489
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:07,880
That's all. Whoever watched to the end, congratulations.

490
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:10,360
Considered that your learning just this much already came out.

491
00:43:10,360 --> 00:43:12,980
Whoever didn't come out but learned all 3 ways already.

492
00:43:14,199 --> 00:43:15,619
You must go back and review. It's up to you.

493
00:43:17,039 --> 00:43:20,039
You'll get additional tools here. See? This.

494
00:43:20,039 --> 00:43:33,760
And even more, whoever learned Season 2 too.

495
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:35,940
Congratulations, you almost have the complete set.

496
00:43:36,360 --> 00:43:37,719
Others also see the chart, the candles like this.

497
00:43:38,380 --> 00:43:40,539
But they don't see like this. See what's hidden. But you see.

498
00:43:41,079 --> 00:43:42,900
Bring it to apply and use. Everyone good luck.
