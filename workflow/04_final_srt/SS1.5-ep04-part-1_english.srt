1
00:00:01,879 --> 00:00:11,039
Let's look at some chart examples now. We've studied the theory.

2
00:00:11,039 --> 00:00:23,760
Starting with something simple first - support and resistance like this.

3
00:00:24,179 --> 00:00:31,760
Price reverses like this, and there will be candlesticks.

4
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:38,740
Occurring at this point and this point - there are 3 types, remember?

5
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:50,579
The balance scale - Action and Reaction.

6
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:56,799
There are 3 patterns - balanced, or heavier on one side or the other.

7
00:00:56,799 --> 00:01:00,899
Let's see how this plays out when applied to real charts.

8
00:01:01,219 --> 00:01:06,920
Let's look at the important support and resistance points first.

9
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:18,680
Let me scroll and look. This point here is important support.

10
00:01:18,980 --> 00:01:19,379
Right here.

11
00:01:19,879 --> 00:01:21,760
Zoom in to look. Right here.

12
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:26,000
We'll see price bouncing back.

13
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:31,620
Just like the theory taught.

14
00:01:32,019 --> 00:01:36,980
See how here it moves down like this, right?

15
00:01:37,579 --> 00:01:41,719
But this section drops normally, and then there's a part where it becomes...

16
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:44,939
The high part sticking out - what's that called? Sideways.

17
00:01:46,579 --> 00:01:49,140
It's like this, right?

18
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:55,200
Comes down like this, and here is the consolidation zone - Sideway, see?

19
00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:00,599
Moving Sideway like this. We'll come back to look at this part later.

20
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:06,219
Let's look at other examples first. Alright, now we'll see that here...

21
00:02:06,219 --> 00:02:19,360
This candle first - it swings down and then comes back up.

22
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:24,099
Looking at the Action side - the side that pushed down - and Reaction going up.

23
00:02:24,419 --> 00:02:31,340
We have Action which is this candle, but we have no Reaction at all. See?

24
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:37,460
Coming back, there's no candle that exceeds this axis candle going up.

25
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:43,699
The axis is marked here - this is the axis. There's nothing, which means price...

26
00:02:43,699 --> 00:02:47,039
In the direction of price movement, there's no candle that made...

27
00:02:47,039 --> 00:02:50,120
A higher high anymore. So price obviously has to...

28
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:54,520
Go down, that's it. No matter what, it has to drop.

29
00:02:58,199 --> 00:03:01,259
Now when it drops, let's see if it does the same thing here.

30
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:06,520
See? Here it becomes... ah, I'm going to change the marker.

31
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:10,159
Coming up to here, this becomes the highest point.

32
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:13,400
And this one here, at the end of this candle...

33
00:03:13,659 --> 00:03:18,199
This point becomes the new axis instead. See? This is the axis candle.

34
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:25,060
The tip - this tip here - is at the highest price of this one.

35
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:27,099
Mark this candle first because you can see it, see? Right here.

36
00:03:27,099 --> 00:03:35,080
Zoom in. Which one? Right here, see?

37
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:40,099
The tip is here. This becomes the axis because this is the highest swing point.

38
00:03:40,439 --> 00:03:45,180
Now we find Action and Reaction. This line - I'll make the line...

39
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:48,439
Change color a bit. Because if I don't change it, the lines will look the same.

40
00:03:48,439 --> 00:03:53,900
So it's here, and looking at this side - the green side coming up...

41
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:57,500
Action is the green side - is there a candle that exceeds and wins? Not this one.

42
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:03,599
Already there. We need opposite colors - they have to be different colors.

43
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:10,560
But the axis can be any color. This one here - found it.

44
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:17,579
Draw a line at the tip here. See how this one compares to that one?

45
00:04:17,579 --> 00:04:20,980
This one wins. See? It dropped lower, which means...

46
00:04:21,579 --> 00:04:30,920
Action - look - Action has more power than Reaction, so it will drop...

47
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:34,560
Lower than this low for sure. So price just plunges down like this.

48
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:41,240
Breaking down, see how it just keeps going? This one tries to go up but has no strength.

49
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:44,699
See? Can't rally back higher than this one.

50
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:54,319
Not enough power to reach this zone. But the downside force says it has more power, so it just takes price down.

51
00:04:55,319 --> 00:05:04,040
Price drops down to this point. Can it come back up and beat this one? Let's look again.

52
00:05:05,399 --> 00:05:11,699
This is the lowest, right? Draw down to here - the lowest tip. This is the axis, correct?

53
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:21,100
And find its price at the tip where it bounced up - the highest one here. Mark it.

54
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:30,899
So let's continue looking - the Action side is this one, the opposite side...

55
00:05:32,079 --> 00:05:33,160
Comes up about this much.

56
00:05:33,399 --> 00:05:33,600
Right.

57
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:43,519
Look at this - see how it exceeds half? Comparing them, they're evenly matched, so it can't beat this High going back up.

58
00:05:43,519 --> 00:05:50,240
These forces trying to push back up can't make it. Just gets up about this much.

59
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:54,779
From Season 1, if you read Momentum, you'll already see this is the mother candle.

60
00:05:56,579 --> 00:06:00,300
Can't come in to attack or kill the mother candle here.

61
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:02,579
So this army wins. This is the main force.

62
00:06:02,579 --> 00:06:04,500
These are small forces, decoy forces, medium forces.

63
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:05,860
Still can't make it in the end.

64
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:07,939
Gets beaten back every time anyway.

65
00:06:07,939 --> 00:06:09,920
This is if you're reading momentum.

66
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:13,120
If you're reading purely reversal candlestick patterns...

67
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:15,480
Just follow this method.

68
00:06:15,779 --> 00:06:19,259
You can call it Action Reaction or the balance scale candlestick pattern.

69
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:22,660
You get this characteristic. We've seen it can't win.

70
00:06:23,079 --> 00:06:25,639
Comes up to here, then let's move and look...

71
00:06:25,639 --> 00:06:30,560
Does it have downward momentum to continue? The red - you'll see the red is higher.

72
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,540
I'll mark at the red candle.

73
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:41,600
Here. Once I mark the red candle, it's at the price that came down to the red body - not the wick.

74
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:48,839
And look at Action versus Reaction - moving this - make this line thinner.

75
00:06:48,839 --> 00:06:55,339
And make it a tip line. Who has a tip? Use a tip instead.

76
00:06:55,339 --> 00:07:00,480
Like this - this is the axis. Find the Action and Reaction buying - where is it?

77
00:07:02,199 --> 00:07:05,240
The one exceeding on this side - this one doesn't count because it's absorbed...

78
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:08,180
Combined power with this one - it doesn't exceed.

79
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:13,019
This one exceeds, right? Count this one. Once we count it, draw a line.

80
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:19,120
Like this here. See how this red candle wins?

81
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:24,480
Which means Action force is higher, so it can break through this low going down.

82
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:27,819
It can break lower, so it does. Now if you're trading and you see this...

83
00:07:28,519 --> 00:07:34,240
Instead of waiting to buy, waiting to find the buy point for a reversal, you can just follow the steps.

84
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:40,000
Following the steps means - let's say you saw it from which point...

85
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,600
At this point you're not sure if it will come back up, but once you see the signal here...

86
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:49,420
You can sell going down. And where do you place stop loss? Right here.

87
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:54,360
It flows down. Comes back up here - add more sells if you want, stop loss stays here.

88
00:07:56,199 --> 00:08:00,379
Sell - it keeps selling down. Price keeps dropping because we know it will drop.

89
00:08:00,379 --> 00:08:06,980
Because we measured the force we saw from this pattern. So it drops...

90
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:14,160
Down to here, down to here, then we look again. Which one becomes the new axis?

91
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:18,180
The lowest one is this one. See?

92
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:23,300
Find both prices - where's the tip here? This one. Check Action versus Reaction again.

93
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:29,680
Coming across to the edge. See how Action - that's right...

94
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:34,620
Price dropping down like this - this one here. Is there any Reaction going up?

95
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:37,580
Not a single winning candle here. So...

96
00:08:38,419 --> 00:08:43,120
Price has no way to fight back and go up. No way to reverse higher.

97
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:46,559
It has to continue down. So it gradually seeps down further like this.

98
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:50,600
Until reaching this point again - it's a swing point. We're tracking swings continuously like this.

99
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:55,620
This swing has no upward momentum. See? It has Action but...

100
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:59,759
The Reaction force - meaning the bounce back or counter-reaction reflecting back...

101
00:08:59,759 --> 00:09:02,299
Has no power. Can't reflect back out.

102
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:06,480
So it must follow the same direction - the Trend, following its Trend.

103
00:09:06,799 --> 00:09:09,899
Which is downtrend. Because what does it make?

104
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:22,679
High, Low, Lower High, Lower Low, Lower High, Lower Low, Lower High, Lower Low.

105
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:26,379
In one direction - becoming a staircase stepping down continuously.

106
00:09:26,379 --> 00:09:29,480
Until meeting this one. This one stands out.

107
00:09:30,379 --> 00:09:34,240
Gets a new axis as this one. And is it at an important zone?

108
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:42,480
This is important support here because it connects with a previous point.

109
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:44,799
Bounces up from there - worth watching.

110
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:51,740
So - is it important support? Let's use it, consider it.

111
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:59,980
Coming down - marking the lowest point here. At...

112
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:04,500
Its tip here. And looking left and right - this one exceeds by a full candle.

113
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:08,259
Half of it is here. So this one exceeds - mark it first.

114
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:14,879
Like this. And this side - does this candle count? This one. See - it exceeds...

115
00:10:15,259 --> 00:10:19,899
Half should be about here, but this doesn't reach. Which means its force...

116
00:10:19,899 --> 00:10:23,200
These two are basically the same. They're absorbing each other's energy.

117
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:28,019
So we have to count this one. Count this one. There's a line - where'd the line go?

118
00:10:28,879 --> 00:10:39,580
Three lines. Get another one. See? This one can beat that one.

119
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:44,559
This one. Comparing this to that one - this is higher. Close is higher.

120
00:10:45,039 --> 00:10:51,860
The candle is higher. So in a Reaction scenario, it has more power.

121
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:56,740
It's starting already - this one has more power compared to that one. See?

122
00:10:57,980 --> 00:11:03,379
Stronger than this one. Stronger than the previous one that had no Reaction side at all.

123
00:11:03,379 --> 00:11:07,320
Which means this has higher power. So the High around this area...

124
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:13,240
Will be hit. Has a chance to be hit. So price can go above it.

125
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:15,679
Yeah. So price will run and rise up.

126
00:11:15,679 --> 00:11:23,159
Gradually going up, and eventually comes above it for real. And consolidates. See? Consolidates then makes a new swing.

127
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:31,700
Look again. Check this new point - will price continue or will it drop like this? Here, clear this first.

128
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:52,100
So which one becomes the axis? Going down - swinging, following this. Use this one as the axis.

129
00:11:55,159 --> 00:12:01,220
Following here, see? Balance scale. Get the balance scale shape? Go to the tip, body only.

130
00:12:05,059 --> 00:12:10,240
At the red. This is Action, this is Reaction. See how Reaction wins? See?

131
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:13,820
So price continues up. The High is here already.

132
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:20,159
High is here. See? The connection zone like this.

133
00:12:22,019 --> 00:12:25,919
Price rallies from here upward, running up.

134
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:31,000
Because here the Reaction force is higher - this is...

135
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:38,080
Action and Reaction. This one pushes through up, until beating this High.

136
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:47,080
Can it continue? Already beat the High. I said it can reach the High.

137
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:52,740
As for whether it consolidates after reaching the High - like this point where it beat the High then consolidated and continued...

138
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:56,799
Or consolidates then reverses - either is possible. We have to consider.

139
00:12:57,679 --> 00:13:02,820
What price is hinting to us - this one, the highest is here.

140
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:10,299
Draw up to here, see? The highest point is here - this red candle is the axis candle.

141
00:13:10,299 --> 00:13:14,220
See the axis candle? Look left and right the same way - looking to the left...

142
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:21,340
This candle no, no, no - this candle, see? Coming up, mark at this candle.

143
00:13:21,899 --> 00:13:31,840
And looking at the right side - this is Action. Now we find the Reaction side. See? Reaction dropped, coming down this much.

144
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:40,620
Strong? Very strong. Came up very strong. This one said it can go up, and it did go up already. Did its job here.

145
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:45,679
But coming down, comparing forces with this one - looking at power, it's much higher than this.

146
00:13:45,679 --> 00:13:50,299
So it pushes and slaps price down quite hard like this.

147
00:13:50,559 --> 00:13:54,179
It might not just pullback and continue - it drops hard like this.

148
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:58,779
Drops hard, drops long and easy, almost breaks through support.

149
00:13:59,019 --> 00:14:02,500
Broke already - yeah broke already, actually broke down. Because this one has way more strength.

150
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:07,159
Comparing both sides' power - between this one going up and this one going down...

151
00:14:07,159 --> 00:14:09,879
This one has more power. See?

152
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:14,539
Geography is sensitive here - they win by just a little, see?

153
00:14:14,779 --> 00:14:16,860
Win by just a little between this green and this red.

154
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:24,259
But this balance scale - this red versus this green - wins by a lot.

155
00:14:24,259 --> 00:14:28,759
So this one's downward force is much stronger. Takes it down like this.

156
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:33,059
Once it takes it down like this, we continue watching. Clear these markers first.

157
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:43,740
It becomes this point. We draw across - there. Like this.

158
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:48,200
This one becomes the new balance scale, new axis balance scale.

159
00:14:51,679 --> 00:14:57,559
Mark around this area. See anything? Looking back at this side - can use this one.

160
00:14:57,559 --> 00:15:02,059
This is the Action side. And Reaction? Does it exceed half?

161
00:15:02,059 --> 00:15:07,399
This one exceeds half, but loses to this one. See?

162
00:15:07,399 --> 00:15:13,720
This pattern loses to this one. So it can't beat this High.

163
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:27,000
And it keeps dropping, dropping, dropping...

164
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:33,220
Gets this candle - this one. Red here - not this red.

165
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:36,700
This red. Small red - small because it already gave away half. Already gave away...

166
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:40,519
Half already. But where's the green? Green gets here. Does it have strength? Yes.

167
00:15:40,519 --> 00:15:56,980
Stronger. See? So it will make a higher high.

168
00:15:56,980 --> 00:16:04,360
Talking about reversal points - reversal points look like this.

169
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:07,740
Reversal point like this, see? Violent - going up fine then slaps down.

170
00:16:08,419 --> 00:16:12,539
Ends in Sideway like this, then we'll talk later. This one - downtrend coming down long.

171
00:16:13,019 --> 00:16:18,460
Meets this point, it reverses upward. Reverse in terms of becoming an uptrend going up.

172
00:16:19,379 --> 00:16:24,019
See the subtraction? All gone. Now it's an uptrend.

173
00:16:24,019 --> 00:16:27,600
Coming up, coming up long. Starting from here.

174
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:30,820
Coming up like this, then it flips back, right? Flips back to being like this.

175
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:36,860
Same thing. We look at it the same way. We find...

176
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:41,860
Following this - it will have... from the lowest point inside...

177
00:16:44,879 --> 00:16:48,899
If counting, this one might be the one that broke through the swing.

178
00:16:48,899 --> 00:16:50,480
But we don't use it. It's not a swing point.

179
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:53,659
It's not the characteristic of down then up.

180
00:16:54,019 --> 00:16:58,440
It's just one of the candlestick formations along the way, this one.

181
00:17:01,019 --> 00:17:05,700
Actually it might be this one. Use this one - we look at both sides.

182
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:16,579
Comparing them. What we get is the red candle - gets this whole side.

183
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:20,779
Red is this one. Green is this one. See how they can't compete?

184
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:26,140
This is High-derm - it can't Hi-derm through immediately.

185
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:31,539
See how it reaches then pullbacks down to consolidate here?

186
00:17:31,539 --> 00:17:37,640
So the axis would be here. Price continues going up.

187
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:43,759
The Action side - red - versus Reaction side - green - doesn't exceed.

188
00:17:43,759 --> 00:17:48,339
Half of it is at the midpoint. This one is at the midpoint, half.

189
00:17:48,339 --> 00:17:51,960
Maybe doesn't quite reach, so doesn't count. We count this one. See? It can continue.

190
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:54,259
So it can make a higher high than this High.

191
00:17:54,259 --> 00:17:56,039
Which means price will continue running.

192
00:17:56,039 --> 00:17:58,880
Now we start seeing Trend because it's starting to become Low...

193
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:04,740
High-Low and got High-High going up already. See?

194
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:08,099
Going up, going up long.

195
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:12,400
Actually, we can compare many things. Measuring force...

196
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:16,700
Here is less, here is more. Measuring force here compared to...

197
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:19,619
Here - more. Because, see how it ran...

198
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:35,619
Further. This is one part - there's a clue, a hint.

199
00:18:35,619 --> 00:18:38,460
Sitting and reading candle tiers like this can be tiring.

200
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:40,240
You find this period is very important anyway.

201
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:42,079
This one - let's be careful with this.

202
00:18:42,319 --> 00:18:45,940
For those who studied Season 2 already - you can see the future here.

203
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:49,680
From this point to here, you already know where price will go next, approximately.

204
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:51,500
Very clearly.

205
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:53,119
Very clearly.

206
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:57,119
Price runs up to here.

207
00:18:57,119 --> 00:19:02,839
And we move on, move on, move on - it becomes this point.

208
00:19:03,259 --> 00:19:09,940
See? Here. Comparing them. It dropped momentarily, but actually this one...

209
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:14,140
Looks more like this one. But remember, whatever technique...

210
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:25,559
We've talked about - on the day they learned up to...

211
00:19:25,559 --> 00:19:29,180
Higher Low. When it reaches this point, we don't know yet. It might continue dropping.

212
00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:32,400
We might be looking at the chart. Let's say we don't know yet. We see this shape...

213
00:19:32,779 --> 00:19:36,000
Hey, will it slap down to here? It has a chance.

214
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:39,259
But it doesn't slap - it comes down here then bounces back up like this.

215
00:19:39,259 --> 00:19:43,799
We have to reconsider. Reconsider.

216
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:47,420
After reconsidering, it still doesn't look strong. Here it can only go up a little.

217
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:53,420
Compared to here it went up a lot. See here? Do you see the Action and Reaction here?

218
00:19:54,059 --> 00:20:00,240
Coming down to here already. This green candle works. This red wins. Action wins, Reaction is small.

219
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:04,579
So it shouldn't go far. But it might... it might break through. It shouldn't break though.

220
00:20:04,579 --> 00:20:08,319
But it does break. What shouldn't happen, but does happen...

221
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:12,019
What will happen next is - it will get pushed back down harder than before.

222
00:20:12,339 --> 00:20:15,900
Like this. It doesn't just consolidate and continue.

223
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:25,720
It comes up, breaks this High - true. Breaks it - true. But eventually price gets pushed back down lower than before. See?

224
00:20:26,119 --> 00:20:31,119
It shouldn't have made it, but it did. So it will be pushed back down harder than before anyway.

225
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:37,819
From the signals we read. This will slap hard because we'll see signals here already.

226
00:20:37,819 --> 00:20:43,980
The axis. Balance scale on the other side - it slaps down on this side. Looking at this side...

227
00:20:44,619 --> 00:20:49,200
It would be moved here, right? This is it. This side - is there anything?

228
00:20:52,119 --> 00:20:58,519
Nothing at all. So price can't. It's hard to push through...

229
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:06,859
Through this zone easily. And it doesn't go through at all. See?

230
00:21:06,859 --> 00:21:11,400
Goes up then down, down, down. Goes up then down. But gradually lifting up.

231
00:21:11,799 --> 00:21:19,740
We gradually measure its force continuously. This point. Coming to this point.

232
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:23,819
Thinking red versus green - lower. Red is lower. The red one...

233
00:21:31,279 --> 00:21:34,380
This one exceeds toward the direction. Count this one. Don't count that one. Count this.

234
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:39,099
And look at the green. This one doesn't count - they're absorbing each other. Same group.

235
00:21:39,099 --> 00:21:40,859
This one breaks out quite a bit.

236
00:21:40,859 --> 00:21:43,859
From previously small, becoming big like this.

237
00:21:43,859 --> 00:22:01,099
So the chance to continue running until breaking through here, making a new High...

238
00:22:01,099 --> 00:22:03,759
It still goes up. Once it goes up...

239
00:22:05,299 --> 00:22:07,480
Then we look at the next point again.

240
00:22:08,339 --> 00:22:10,819
This is an uptrend candle - this one is the center.

241
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:14,460
Right here. Mark at this point.

242
00:22:15,299 --> 00:22:16,539
So this side - what do we count?

243
00:22:16,539 --> 00:22:19,940
Count this one, right? Green is Action, and red is Reaction.

244
00:22:20,359 --> 00:22:21,000
It's small.

245
00:22:22,119 --> 00:22:25,579
It's small. So it might drop a bit then continue.

246
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:26,079
Coming...

247
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:42,920
So it drops down but can't go lower than the previous low because Reaction is small. This side has small Reaction, so it pullbacks down but can't go lower than the previous low. It becomes this low - it doesn't go lower. Comes down about this much. Still lifting - the low keeps lifting up like this.

248
00:22:43,519 --> 00:22:45,319
Higher Low, Higher Low, Higher Low.

249
00:22:47,019 --> 00:22:49,220
But what we'll see next is...

250
00:22:49,220 --> 00:22:50,859
From this point onward...

251
00:22:51,119 --> 00:22:53,799
The uptrend from here on...

252
00:22:53,799 --> 00:22:57,079
It's stuck - no Reaction force anymore.

253
00:22:57,079 --> 00:23:00,700
Coming down like this - no more Reaction.

254
00:23:01,079 --> 00:23:03,619
Becomes having Action but Reaction side, see?

255
00:23:03,619 --> 00:23:05,140
No green candle exceeding this one.

256
00:23:05,140 --> 00:23:08,380
Going up - just one tiny bit. Nothing.

257
00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:12,299
It won't be like when it was coming up during this period - wherever you touch...

258
00:23:12,299 --> 00:23:17,640
There's still green. Even if it had little power - Reaction small means returns are small, or can't push through...

259
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:21,039
Then has to come down to form again. It will have its patterns continuously.

260
00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:26,019
Like this side, like this pattern, see? This red one - it's very similar to this.

261
00:23:26,019 --> 00:23:30,319
See this red? Is there a green mark? No. So it doesn't push through.

262
00:23:30,599 --> 00:23:51,019
Actually this one might be indicating that the trend is about to end.

263
00:23:51,019 --> 00:23:56,759
It's forcing it. Forcing already. Same here - looks like it should've ended here.

264
00:23:58,619 --> 00:24:04,059
From Season 2 perspective, you'll already see it should've ended here. Should've dropped from here.

265
00:24:04,259 --> 00:24:09,759
If we read the chart, it should start dropping. But it's forcing, it goes up.

266
00:24:12,420 --> 00:24:15,279
Was there a signal to go up? Yes there was. We just looked at it.

267
00:24:15,279 --> 00:24:19,079
Just now it just said - hey, it can go up, there's still upward momentum. So it went up.

268
00:24:19,079 --> 00:24:23,740
Eventually it drops. Once it drops, it starts saying can't go up anymore.

269
00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:27,059
It will repeat the pattern around here. Can't do it.

270
00:24:27,579 --> 00:24:29,779
But it forms again until it says it can.

271
00:24:29,779 --> 00:24:35,660
And let's see if it can form again here. It drops down, down, down...

272
00:24:36,059 --> 00:24:36,400
There.

273
00:24:40,599 --> 00:24:47,420
We count this one and this one. This one - not that one.

274
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:52,099
See this one? It already exceeded. Its open and close are here.

275
00:24:52,099 --> 00:24:58,299
Its body is smaller than this one. So it has less strength...

276
00:24:58,299 --> 00:25:04,359
To push through to here. And it gets trapped back down like this. See?

277
00:25:04,359 --> 00:25:08,019
It has its signals telling us continuously like this. This is reading for...

278
00:25:10,460 --> 00:25:16,059
Reversals. Like this - let's look at its shape. If it's a Pattern, you'll see...

279
00:25:16,819 --> 00:25:21,680
It has characteristics kind of cutting out like this.

280
00:25:23,279 --> 00:25:26,839
If you draw it, what does it look like? It's like Head and Shoulders.

281
00:25:27,339 --> 00:25:30,980
See? And we've studied this already.

282
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:37,160
When dropping here, there has to be a candlestick pattern or balance scale pattern...

283
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:41,440
That says Reaction has downward force, strong enough to push down. Which pattern?

284
00:25:42,359 --> 00:25:45,960
This pattern, right? Where it will bounce back up. At this point.

285
00:25:47,359 --> 00:25:52,059
And the red is more than the green side. This one is quite a lot.

286
00:25:52,059 --> 00:25:57,240
Eventually it takes price down with this much force. And just like we read earlier...

287
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:02,559
It continues on and on, long, until it breaks and changes trend direction like this.

288
00:26:02,559 --> 00:26:10,619
This one is about Sideway. So about that much should be enough to understand first.

289
00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:17,779
As for this part - if we look at when it was trending up, we drew earlier that it was support, right?

290
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:25,339
What pattern do we see? Like this. See? It has characteristics of Double Bottom.

291
00:26:25,779 --> 00:26:35,740
The first Bottom point - first point - force wasn't enough to push through. Had to come make a second force with more strength.

292
00:26:35,740 --> 00:26:40,160
Just barely pushes through. It hints like this. The balance scale hints like this.

293
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:45,380
You sit and read it like this. Same here. This point - not enough force to push down.

294
00:26:45,619 --> 00:26:50,500
This point - not enough force to push down. But the last one has the most force. So it pushes down.

295
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:53,240
It's like this. Because we read them together.

296
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:56,079
This one we read just the candlesticks, the balance scale pattern only.

297
00:26:56,079 --> 00:26:59,220
The Action and Reaction pattern. If you try reading with Momentum...

298
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:03,099
And theory, and principles from Season 2 combined...

299
00:27:03,099 --> 00:27:20,480
Even clearer - you'll see the chart picture even more clearly.

300
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:23,839
Your entry points - you'll get them already. Forgot to talk about entry points.

301
00:27:24,380 --> 00:27:26,140
When you enter, you just let it flow continuously...

302
00:27:26,140 --> 00:27:29,640
Until you find... until you find...

303
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:34,380
What I said will drop hard.

304
00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:36,700
Let's say you buy, right? You buy. Here you buy.

305
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:39,400
You just let it flow continuously. Either way, weigh it.

306
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:43,279
Until you find the point it tells you - the other side becomes a balance scale that says...

307
00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:46,799
Will drop hard. Then you exit. Exit slowly.

308
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:51,079
Stop Loss would be here. Take Profit or Exit...

309
00:27:51,079 --> 00:27:55,259
Is about here. If you Buy - if you Sell, you Sell...

310
00:27:55,259 --> 00:27:59,740
But here. We let it flow continuously until you find the point it says...

311
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,980
Won't drop anymore. There's opposite force going up.

312
00:28:03,539 --> 00:28:07,400
Then exit. That's it - just let it flow easily like this. That's all.

313
00:28:07,799 --> 00:28:11,119
We look at 3 candles, right?

314
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:15,420
Some people don't understand. Let's say...

315
00:28:15,420 --> 00:28:19,599
You'll Buy. Buy - now we have to...

316
00:28:19,599 --> 00:28:22,240
Wait for all 3, right?

317
00:28:23,279 --> 00:28:27,359
Have to wait for 3. So if we Buy, we'll buy - the 4th candle, this zone.

318
00:28:28,059 --> 00:28:35,119
This whole area where we can buy - let price run up until meeting a new pattern we mentioned...

319
00:28:35,119 --> 00:28:41,759
That might not be trustworthy anymore, better to exit. Same thing. If you'll Sell going down...

320
00:28:42,599 --> 00:28:47,599
Which candle? This pattern, right? Right here.

321
00:28:50,259 --> 00:28:54,380
Count this one. Not dropping hard yet. Comes back up, this zone.

322
00:28:54,380 --> 00:28:59,700
Drops hard - if counting this one. After this candle - half the zone of this whole candle...

323
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:04,559
You can sell anywhere in this range. This area.

324
00:29:05,019 --> 00:29:09,920
This area approximately. I count from half of this candle.

325
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:14,859
This red candle here. Because price retraces up, swings up within the red candle zone...

326
00:29:15,759 --> 00:29:18,799
All of it - can sell to let it flow down. Same here.

327
00:29:19,220 --> 00:29:23,259
Would be around this green candle, right? This green doesn't push through.

328
00:29:23,259 --> 00:29:29,539
And we count this green candle - half of it - to catch.

329
00:29:30,099 --> 00:29:34,099
The upper half, to be sure.

330
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:40,319
Price in this zone - you buy going up.

331
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:43,619
Let it go until meeting the one that reverses back. That's it.

332
00:29:44,759 --> 00:29:47,099
That's it. The order entry method is very simple.

333
00:29:47,099 --> 00:29:51,880
If using the balance scale principle, or Action Reaction...

334
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:56,519
Just look at this - did you find the reversal reflection yet?

335
00:29:57,279 --> 00:30:00,460
Let it flow continuously. However it goes, doesn't matter.

336
00:30:02,079 --> 00:30:05,599
Until it meets one with equal force - that says Reaction looks strong already.

337
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:10,799
Exit. Entry - you enter, and it just flows continuously like this.

338
00:30:11,119 --> 00:30:15,500
You apply or combine this with understanding from Season 1...

339
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:26,500
Those who studied the bonus already - that's another part.

340
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:30,039
About Sideway or consolidation.
