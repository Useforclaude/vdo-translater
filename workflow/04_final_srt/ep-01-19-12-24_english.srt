00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,720
Hello everyone, welcome to the Forex Pre-Action course.

2
00:00:04,139 --> 00:00:09,300
We'll read candlesticks like reading a story - understanding the meaning behind the price action.

3
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:14,720
Let's just get started right away - we'll cut straight to the point, no fluff.

4
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:22,480
But for those who already have a basic understanding of candlesticks,

5
00:00:23,139 --> 00:00:26,920
what they mean and how to read them, you can skip ahead to the next lesson.

6
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:34,700
This is for complete beginners who don't yet understand candlestick charts,

7
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:39,560
what they look like, what they mean, and how to read them.

8
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:52,460
This lesson will be the absolute basics.

9
00:00:56,680 --> 00:01:00,600
Let's start with charts.

10
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:03,939
With Price Action, we look at charts like this second one here.

11
00:01:03,939 --> 00:01:08,180
What I mean by "naked" chart is,

12
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:11,500
we'll still use some tools,

13
00:01:13,339 --> 00:01:16,260
like drawing lines here and there to help with the analysis.

14
00:01:16,519 --> 00:01:20,159
But we won't be using

15
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:24,000
lots of stuff like this.

16
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:28,480
We won't use tons of indicators. Some traders who have their own system

17
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:31,700
are comfortable with this approach.

18
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:35,939
They look at where indicators cross, which points

19
00:01:35,939 --> 00:01:40,780
are interesting for selling or buying.

20
00:01:41,039 --> 00:01:50,140
But for Price Action traders, they prefer analysis that's

21
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:51,420
clean like this - nice and clear.

22
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:56,659
Price Action consists of three main components.

23
00:01:57,620 --> 00:02:01,659
At minimum - there could be more depending on each trader's specific techniques.

24
00:02:01,659 --> 00:02:05,840
But at minimum, anyone using Price Action will use these three things.

25
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:11,460
First is Candlestick analysis. Next is Support and Resistance levels.

26
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:15,340
Resistance and Support, and the last one is Dow Theory.

27
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:20,460
This is really important - Dow Theory, trends, and market direction.

28
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:24,120
Now let's get to know candlesticks.

29
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:27,280
For those who don't know or are still new to this.

30
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:31,599
Actually, when we configure candlesticks in our platform,

31
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:34,379
we can set them to any color we want.

32
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:39,539
Here, I'll use green to represent bullish candles - upward movement.

33
00:02:39,539 --> 00:02:45,159
"Bullish" means the price keeps moving up - buy low, sell high.

34
00:02:45,159 --> 00:03:04,360
Red candles mean the price is dropping - bearish movement, for selling.

35
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:15,860
From this image, you can see the opening price is here, and when the candle closes, the price has moved from here up continuously.

36
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:26,560
It might drop first to make a low point, then move up to make a high point, and then close.

37
00:03:26,979 --> 00:03:34,000
Simply put - a bullish green candle means the close price is higher than the open price.

38
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:41,280
For red candles, the close is lower than the open - meaning the price dropped.

39
00:03:42,819 --> 00:03:47,199
The price keeps dropping, pulling back. Green means the price keeps rising.

40
00:03:47,199 --> 00:03:52,319
Keeps going up. Now, if you see candles like this,

41
00:03:52,319 --> 00:04:01,080
with no wicks sticking out, no tails - it still has the same four price components.

42
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:09,919
It's just that the open price overlaps with another price - the open IS the low of this candle.

43
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:14,599
And the close price IS also the high of this candle.

44
00:04:15,159 --> 00:04:16,899
Vice versa - same thing for this one.

45
00:04:17,179 --> 00:04:19,839
The high price is the open price of this candle.

46
00:04:20,379 --> 00:04:23,839
Then it got pushed down by selling pressure until it closed here.

47
00:04:23,839 --> 00:04:25,920
This becomes the low point where it closed.

48
00:04:26,459 --> 00:04:28,480
It closed at the same level as that price.

49
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:32,620
So no matter if the candle has a tail, has wicks, or no wicks,

50
00:04:34,519 --> 00:04:38,120
it must always have these four prices.

51
00:04:39,659 --> 00:04:42,100
Now these are some other variations you might see.

52
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:44,019
We've already covered this shape.

53
00:04:44,539 --> 00:04:47,439
Like this one - it still has four prices.

54
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:53,399
Opens here, then moves up or down, but when the candle closes,

55
00:04:53,399 --> 00:04:58,259
it comes back and closes at the same level as the open - that's why it looks like just a single line.

56
00:04:58,259 --> 00:05:17,420
But there are actually two prices overlapping - the open and close prices.

57
00:05:18,159 --> 00:05:21,540
It reached this low point, and the open and close are together here.

58
00:05:21,839 --> 00:05:24,019
That's why the prices are overlapping.

59
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:29,959
Here's a simple explanation of price movement.

60
00:05:30,199 --> 00:05:34,620
If it opens here and has a wick below, that means the price must have gone lower than the open.

61
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:38,439
So it might have opened, dropped down, then moved back up.

62
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:54,379
Until it reaches this high point then falls back to close a bit, or it could open and go straight up to make the high, then drop all the way to the low, and climb back up to close around here - not higher than this, so it stays at this level.

63
00:05:54,379 --> 00:05:59,379
These two candles look the same, but the actual price movement was different - see that?

64
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:03,660
So the simple conclusion is - a candle can move in any way.

65
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:09,879
You just need to know that it must always have these four prices to form a candlestick.

66
00:06:11,519 --> 00:06:16,600
You should understand now - no matter what kind of candle it is, like this one,

67
00:06:19,079 --> 00:06:24,259
opens here, moves around somehow - drops to here then bounces back up,

68
00:06:24,259 --> 00:06:28,379
or it could go up first, reach this point, and close here.

69
00:06:28,379 --> 00:06:46,579
When it closes here, time's up and a new candle starts - the prices must connect like this.

70
00:06:49,779 --> 00:06:57,120
Let me show you another example - this is really for beginners so you can visualize it better.

71
00:07:07,459 --> 00:07:11,480
Let's say the opening price comes in - opens right here.

72
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:18,060
Then the price moves around - maybe like this during the hour, keeps moving like this.

73
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:25,459
Drops to here, slowly climbs up, drops again, climbs back up, finally reaches here.

74
00:07:26,119 --> 00:07:31,740
Then it might zigzag around this area, or it could fall - but when the candle's about to close,

75
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:37,980
say it climbs up to here - here we'll get the components.

76
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:48,480
Four components - what are they? The high price - this is the highest price.

77
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:55,500
The open price is here, the lowest price it reached is

78
00:07:55,500 --> 00:08:01,600
here. When the candle forms, it becomes a candle

79
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:11,540
shaped like this - see? Open, close, and the parts sticking out are the wicks.

80
00:08:16,039 --> 00:08:21,420
That's all there is to it. So it doesn't have to move in any specific pattern.

81
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:25,560
It can move however it wants - any pattern is possible.

82
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,879
But in the end, it must always create these four price points.

83
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:31,939
We'll always know exactly where the open is and where the close is,

84
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:35,320
and the highest point it reached and the lowest point it reached.

85
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:38,360
These all combine to form one candle.

86
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:42,519
This is candlesticks for those who are new to trading,

87
00:08:42,519 --> 00:08:46,639
so you understand what candlesticks mean and why they have these different shapes.

88
00:08:46,879 --> 00:08:57,059
To summarize simply - if the close is lower than the open, it's a red candle, a bearish candle.

89
00:08:57,059 --> 00:09:00,820
If the close is higher than the open, it's a green candle, a bullish candle.

90
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:09,000
It's that simple. The shape of the candle depends on how the price moved during that candle's timeframe.

91
00:09:10,899 --> 00:09:12,980
Now we come to candle size.

92
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:16,679
This is a large candle, this is a small candle - small body.

93
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:19,399
Why does it matter? Why do we need to know about large and small candles?

94
00:09:19,399 --> 00:09:23,240
It tells us which one has more strength.

95
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:26,620
Like this candle - if it's a red bearish candle,

96
00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:29,980
talking about selling pressure - between this candle and this candle,

97
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:50,080
it shows the strength in a direction or which side has more control over the other side.

98
00:09:51,599 --> 00:09:52,679
In a case like this,

99
00:09:52,879 --> 00:09:53,600
it's red -

100
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:59,019
we already know that sellers have more strength than buyers.

101
00:09:59,019 --> 00:09:59,700
Read candlesticks like reading a story - understand the meaning behind them.

102
00:09:59,999 --> 00:10:05,879
Let's just get started - we'll cut straight to the point, no fluff.

103
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:11,960
But just a quick note - for those who already understand the basics of candlesticks,

104
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:16,980
what they mean and how to read them - you can skip to the next lesson.

105
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:19,840
This is really basic stuff for absolute beginners - those who don't yet understand candlestick charts,

106
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:23,879
what they look like, what they mean, how to read them - that kind of thing.

107
00:10:23,879 --> 00:10:29,519
This will be the most basic content in this lesson.

108
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:33,120
Let's start with charts.

109
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:36,700
With Price Action, we look at charts like this second one here.

110
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:39,179
It's a clean chart like this - when I say "clean",

111
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:43,320
we actually do use some tools,

112
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:45,360
here and there - like drawing lines to help with analysis.

113
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:47,059
But we won't use

114
00:10:47,059 --> 00:10:48,840
this kind of setup -

115
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:49,759
tons of indicators. Some traders who have their own systems

116
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,179
already developed - they're comfortable with this approach.

117
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:54,820
They look at where things cross, which points are

118
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:56,639
interesting spots to sell or buy - something like that.

119
00:10:57,260 --> 00:10:59,379
But for Price Action traders, they prefer analysis that's

120
00:10:59,379 --> 00:11:00,559
clean like this - nice and clear.

121
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:03,659
Price Action consists of three main components.

122
00:11:03,659 --> 00:11:13,299
At minimum - there could be more depending on each trader's specific techniques.

123
00:11:13,299 --> 00:11:14,379
But at minimum, anyone using Price Action will use these three things.

124
00:11:15,259 --> 00:11:15,799
First is Candlestick analysis. Next is Support and Resistance levels.

125
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:19,100
Resistance and Support, and the last one is Dow Theory.

126
00:11:20,639 --> 00:11:22,799
This is really important - Dow Theory, trends, and market direction.

127
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:26,179
Now let's get to know candlesticks.

128
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:31,879
For those who don't know or are still new to this.

129
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:32,919
Candlesticks - when we set them up,

130
00:11:33,899 --> 00:11:34,500
we can set them to any color we want in the program.

131
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:38,039
Here, I'll use green to represent bullish candlesticks.

132
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:45,259
"Bullish" means the price keeps moving up - buy low, sell high.

133
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:51,440
Something like that. Red candles mean price going down - bearish, for selling.

134
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:56,820
From this diagram, you'll see the open price is here, the close price is when the candle forms - price runs from here and keeps going up.

135
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:59,480
It might drop first, come down to this point to make the low, then run up to make the high, and then close.

136
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:01,139
Simple summary - bullish candle, green candle, means close price is higher than open price.

137
00:12:01,139 --> 00:12:04,320
Red candles - open is higher than close, meaning price is falling.

138
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:05,879
Price is decreasing, pulling back. Green means price is increasing.

139
00:12:05,879 --> 00:12:08,200
Keeps increasing. Now, if you see a candle like this,

140
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:11,019
with no wicks sticking out, no tails - it still has the same four components.

141
00:12:11,019 --> 00:12:12,899
It's just that the open price overlaps with another price - the open IS the low of this candle.

142
00:12:13,379 --> 00:12:16,379
And the close price IS the high of this candle.

143
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:24,299
Vice versa for this one - same thing.

144
00:12:24,299 --> 00:12:29,720
The high is the open price of this candle.

145
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:39,500
Then it gets pushed down by selling pressure until it closes here.

146
00:12:41,639 --> 00:12:46,039
This becomes the low of the candle where it closed.

147
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:53,580
It closes at the same level as that price.

148
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:59,820
So no matter what - whether the candle has tails, wicks, or no wicks,

149
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:06,659
it always consists of these four prices.

150
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:16,059
Now, this section shows other patterns that can form.

151
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:21,379
We've covered this one already - we learned this pattern.

152
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:29,779
Like this one - it still has to have four prices.

153
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:34,080
Opens here, then runs up - or down - but ultimately when the candle closes,

154
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:38,519
it comes back to close at the same level as the open - that's why it's just one line like this.

155
00:13:39,679 --> 00:13:42,019
But there are two prices overlapping - the open and close price.

156
00:13:43,579 --> 00:13:50,600
It runs to this low, with open and close together at this level.

157
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:56,240
That's why the prices overlap.

158
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:03,679
Price movement - this is the simple version.

159
00:14:03,679 --> 00:14:06,460
Opens here, and if there's a wick below, that means price had to go lower than the open.

160
00:14:06,899 --> 00:14:08,820
It might open, drop down, then run back up.

161
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:13,519
Reaches the high here then falls back to close - or it might open and shoot straight up to the high, then drop all the way to the low, then back up to close around here, not higher than this point.

162
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:16,240
These two candles look the same but their price movements are different, see?

163
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:18,659
So in simple terms, one candlestick - it can move however it wants.

164
00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:23,320
You just need to know it always has these four prices to form the candlestick.

165
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:37,340
You should understand by now - no matter what kind of candle, like this one,

166
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:39,600
opens here, moves somehow - it drops to this point then reverses up.

167
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:42,259
Or it might go up first, reach this point, then close here.

168
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:44,139
When it closes here, time's up - a new candle forms, and prices connect like this.

169
00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:46,240
Let me show you another example - this is for complete beginners, you'll see it more clearly.

170
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:46,860
Let's say the open price comes in - open price, opens right here.

171
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:48,019
Then price moves - who knows how - maybe it moves like this for 1 hour, keeps going like this.

172
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:50,019
Then down to here, then gradually up and up, drops again then up and up, climbs to this point.

173
00:14:50,019 --> 00:14:52,720
Then might bounce around this area, or maybe drop back down - but when the candle's about to close,

174
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,259
say it comes up to here - at this point you'll have the four

175
00:14:54,259 --> 00:14:55,480
components - what are they? The high price - this is the high. The

176
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:59,100
open - the open price is here. The low price that it reached is

177
00:15:00,259 --> 00:15:02,720
here. When the candle forms, it becomes a candle

178
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:05,159
like this, see? Open, close, the part sticking out is the wick.

179
00:15:05,159 --> 00:15:08,559
That's all. So it doesn't have to move this exact way.

180
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:25,460
It can move however - anything's possible, any pattern.

181
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:28,500
But ultimately, it always creates those four price points.

182
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:31,740
We'll definitely know where the open and close are.

183
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:34,679
And the highest point it reached and the lowest point it reached.

184
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:37,379
These combine to form one candle.

185
00:15:38,259 --> 00:15:40,500
This is candlesticks for those who are new to trading.

186
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:44,720
Now you know what candlesticks mean, why they have these different shapes.

187
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:47,960
Simple summary - if close is lower than open, it's a red candle, bearish candle.

188
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:55,440
If close is higher than open, it's a green candle, bullish candle.

189
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:56,919
That's it - simple. The shape of the candle depends on how price moved during that candle's timeframe.

190
00:15:56,919 --> 00:15:58,740
Now we get to candle size.

191
00:15:58,740 --> 00:15:59,980
This is a large candle, this is a small candle - small body.

192
00:16:01,019 --> 00:16:02,019
Why is it important? Why do we need to know large vs small candles?

193
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:03,580
It tells us which candle has more strength.

194
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:04,539
Like this candle - if it's red, a bearish candle,

195
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:07,320
we're talking about selling pressure - between this candle and this one.

196
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:08,100
It indicates the momentum in that direction, or which side has more control over the other.

197
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:10,399
In a case like this,

198
00:16:10,759 --> 00:16:12,640
it's red -

199
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:16,259
we already know sellers have more strength than buyers.

200
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:20,500
That's why it's red.

201
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:22,559
But it doesn't have as much pushing power as a large candle.

202
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:25,220
That can push it down this much - this is how we look at momentum.

203
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:29,100
We'll go into more detail about this in the next lesson.

204
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:34,480
About price momentum.

205
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:40,320
That's important for reading charts - reading them like a story.

206
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:46,100
Like a map, like a narrative. Now, which candles

207
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:52,620
are considered large? We know this one - we can see candles large and small.

208
00:16:52,620 --> 00:17:21,119
But when candles actually appear in real trading, they come in groups like this.

209
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:27,559
Which ones are called large? Which are called small?

210
00:17:27,559 --> 00:17:29,220
To determine this, you need to look at context.

211
00:17:35,699 --> 00:17:36,740
The whole group of candles in that area.

212
00:17:41,719 --> 00:17:47,759
If in that group you have candles like this,

213
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:54,380
small, small, small, small - then this one pops up,

214
00:17:54,380 --> 00:18:00,799
this one's called large.

215
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:08,839
But if in their group they're all mixed together,

216
00:18:08,839 --> 00:18:14,539
boom boom boom boom -

217
00:18:14,539 --> 00:18:18,460
it's not called large.

218
00:18:19,659 --> 00:18:23,079
They're about the same - this is called

219
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:25,359
the same group.

220
00:18:25,359 --> 00:18:30,059
This is large. This isn't called large -

221
00:18:30,759 --> 00:18:34,039
significantly large.

222
00:18:34,039 --> 00:18:38,740
This one's called large.

223
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:45,819
See?

224
00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:55,920
But let's say in a group like this,

225
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:59,859
you see this candle - this still isn't called large.

226
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:02,259
They're similar - similar sizes.

227
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:08,440
These are small, small, small - see this one? That's large.

228
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:11,640
Got it?

229
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:19,720
Can you visualize it?

230
00:19:21,139 --> 00:19:27,539
What about other groups?

231
00:19:27,859 --> 00:19:32,599
Earlier we saw a candle like this - called large.

232
00:19:34,939 --> 00:19:38,099
Let's say you see both of them around the same area like this.

233
00:19:38,859 --> 00:19:43,579
This, this, this, this, this, this - these four candles, five candles, six candles -

234
00:19:44,579 --> 00:20:13,359
they're considered similar, not called large yet.

235
00:20:14,519 --> 00:20:19,339
They're in the same group.

236
00:20:21,259 --> 00:20:28,279
The large one is this one - this is called large.

237
00:20:28,279 --> 00:20:32,740
This one could also be called large.

238
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:37,000
Because it stands out a bit.

239
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:41,579
But in terms of momentum, they're still similar if you count the wicks.

240
00:20:42,579 --> 00:20:44,880
Still considered similar - this one doesn't stand out yet.

241
00:20:46,139 --> 00:20:50,400
This one is truly large.

242
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:55,680
This part we'll learn together later.

243
00:20:55,680 --> 00:21:00,900
Let's look first - from the beginning, these small candles we saw, their shape -

244
00:21:01,179 --> 00:21:05,799
there's also this shape - all wick with a small body left.

245
00:21:06,299 --> 00:21:10,940
These are reversal types - this one's a single candle, this one comes in sets.

246
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:13,599
Like this one, here, and here - this is a set. This pair indicates reversal, they have their own names.

247
00:21:13,799 --> 00:21:17,140
Like Engulfing, this one's Railroad or double track - Western names, depends what you call them.

248
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:19,940
Here's Pinbar, a Doji, this one's railroad from above, this is Engulfing from above.

249
00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:22,359
The meaning is price moves - this is Bullish Candlesticks, means it's reversing to bullish.

250
00:21:22,359 --> 00:21:24,099
About to reverse to bullish. Can you picture it?

251
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:27,680
I'll go through this quickly because we haven't reached the key points we need to learn yet.

252
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:32,000
Like price moves this way - it's in a downtrend, keeps dropping.

253
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:36,319
When you see this candle - boom - there's a chance, I say there's a chance it will rise.

254
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:39,920
Other sets are the same - chance of rising.

255
00:21:43,699 --> 00:21:47,319
If you see reversal candles. This one's Bullish Candlesticks -

256
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:52,460
means it's been going up, then sees this one break in - chance of reversing to bearish.

257
00:21:52,939 --> 00:21:56,420
All of them are similar, but we won't memorize them like this.

258
00:21:56,979 --> 00:21:59,339
We won't memorize patterns - like "see this one, it must do that."

259
00:21:59,939 --> 00:22:03,140
It fails quite often if you approach it this way.

260
00:22:04,639 --> 00:22:08,740
Meaning it doesn't work - it might not go up or down according to theory.

261
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:12,839
Or as they say.

262
00:22:14,999 --> 00:22:18,839
Why? Let's take a look.

263
00:22:18,839 --> 00:22:21,640
Here we go - various candlestick patterns.

264
00:22:23,539 --> 00:22:28,240
There are tons of them - this type is a single candle. Look at single candles first - just one that supposedly signals reversal. Now let's look at examples, see?

265
00:22:28,519 --> 00:22:31,740
Here, Doji - something like this around here.

266
00:22:32,359 --> 00:22:36,119
These are supposed to mean reversal.

267
00:22:36,119 --> 00:22:43,140
But when you see them, do they reverse?

268
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:45,039
Maybe a little bit.

269
00:22:47,339 --> 00:22:49,779
In Pin Bar,

270
00:22:49,779 --> 00:22:52,460
Shooting Star -

271
00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:56,279
this one, this bearish candle like this -

272
00:22:56,279 --> 00:22:57,980
should go down. But it doesn't drop, it keeps going up.

273
00:22:57,980 --> 00:23:02,839
If we try to sell around here,

274
00:23:02,839 --> 00:23:04,480
see this candle and sell -

275
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:08,980
looks like it'll work, like it drops a bit, but then it goes back up.

276
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:13,680
See? Well, that means it's not accurate, not right.

277
00:23:14,079 --> 00:23:16,579
See it here, and here again.
