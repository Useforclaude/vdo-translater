1
00:00:02,140 --> 00:00:08,359
Let's continue with this episode. Action and Reaction are our main focus in this section.

2
00:00:08,359 --> 00:00:17,019
Now, you guys get the overall picture, right? But we're gonna expand on it - there are more details to cover.

3
00:00:17,019 --> 00:00:23,899
So far we've just understood that there's Action, and Reaction on this side. This one absorbs the energy.

4
00:00:24,699 --> 00:00:29,280
It gets absorbed and released. Candlesticks and various momentum converge at this point.

5
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:34,579
Reaching a strong, important support level and key zone. Then there's a反force pushing back.

6
00:00:35,219 --> 00:00:41,799
That becomes the Reaction - causing the direction that was moving to reverse.

7
00:00:42,799 --> 00:00:50,219
Now there's more detail than this. Let's look at this diagram. See this? In reality, in the price cycle...

8
00:00:50,219 --> 00:00:55,719
Everything references Dow Theory. The biggest theory. I'll tell you straight - when you learn what comes next, Dow is the foundation.

9
00:00:56,380 --> 00:01:04,599
If you see a chart like this - say you don't see this half yet - or people who learned Season 2, they can predict ahead automatically what direction price will go next.

10
00:01:04,599 --> 00:01:12,640
Totally automatic. Super easy - just glance at it. But this one's gonna fill in the gaps for those who already learned Season 2.

11
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:21,359
Let's look at the price cycle - it looks like this. This is called 1 cycle - going up until down, or down until up, then back up again.

12
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:34,680
Basically an uptrend - going up continuously until it can't go higher. Like hitting a wall. What happens? It starts from Low - what's this? High.

13
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:42,219
You lift the Low, right? So it becomes Higher Low, Higher High, Higher Low.

14
00:01:44,239 --> 00:01:55,280
Higher High, Higher Low - but then it doesn't make a new High. See? No more Higher High. Instead it starts making Lower Low and Lower High.

15
00:01:56,299 --> 00:02:10,080
Another Lower Low, another Lower High. And so on - the cycle looks like this. Uptrend then downtrend. Uptrend, downtrend. Now in these, what else is there? Hold on.

16
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:18,340
We've already learned this. Let's get to what we don't know yet - this one.

17
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:32,360
These are candlesticks - we know there are 3 patterns. It's measuring the power of both sides - Action and Reaction.

18
00:02:37,979 --> 00:02:40,439
So what does it consist of? What's it made of?

19
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:42,620
Normally when price goes up, right?

20
00:02:42,639 --> 00:02:45,860
It doesn't just go up like this straight. Does it? While going up, it has to have ups...

21
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:50,620
And pullbacks, ups and pullbacks, ups and pullbacks - like this.

22
00:02:50,939 --> 00:02:54,000
During the pullbacks, it might just pullback normally and continue up.

23
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:12,620
Or during this pullback zone, it could go sideways.

24
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:18,479
At this point what forms? If it's a workshop rain pattern, it becomes a double top.

25
00:03:18,479 --> 00:03:23,759
Right? Hits the top, comes down. Comes down and bounces.

26
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:28,860
During the downtrend, we say it comes down and bounces up - bounces to continue down.

27
00:03:29,219 --> 00:03:33,960
Consolidating. Consolidating like this. Consolidates then breaks through, continues down.

28
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:39,360
Bounces, can't continue down - hits strong support.

29
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:52,060
Reverses back up. And cycles like this continuously. The price cycle looks like this. Let me erase a bit. Yeah, this works.

30
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:59,159
Now these candlesticks - Action, Reaction, or Passion candlesticks - combine 3 candles. One, two, three - there are 3 patterns. See?

31
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:03,039
Each pattern appears in different locations.

32
00:04:03,039 --> 00:04:06,379
Like this - let me review first what we call them.

33
00:04:06,379 --> 00:04:10,639
What do we call them, right? Better if I change colors.

34
00:04:14,259 --> 00:04:18,500
Blue then. Yeah, this one's normal, see?

35
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:22,160
Balanced means they're roughly equal. Because Action equals Reaction.

36
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:25,779
See how the forces are evenly matched? Look at the body on this one.

37
00:04:25,779 --> 00:04:27,959
Remember we look at the body? This one.

38
00:04:28,959 --> 00:04:31,480
What's happening with this one? Action and Reaction.

39
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:35,680
Action is stronger - this one. Reaction is weaker. See?

40
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:39,019
Reaction can't fight - can't beat Action.

41
00:04:39,019 --> 00:04:41,420
It's lower. It can't beat it.

42
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:46,720
Can't beat Action - this candlestick. So it comes out looking like this.

43
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:50,399
As for another pattern - Action is weaker, or Action...

44
00:04:50,399 --> 00:04:56,139
Wait, Reaction is stronger. Yeah, see how it comes out like this? With all the components...

45
00:04:56,139 --> 00:05:10,240
Complete. It exceeds half of the body.

46
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:14,920
When it goes up, it'll gradually rise like this if it's this pattern.

47
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:19,439
The balanced one. If it's this one though - it goes up without strength.

48
00:05:19,439 --> 00:05:23,600
Not much power going up like this. See? It's weak.

49
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:29,319
Reaction normally responds to the opposite side. Price comes down, bounces up just a tiny bit like this.

50
00:05:29,319 --> 00:05:32,879
Shows it has little power. "Little" means...

51
00:05:34,019 --> 00:05:45,040
It might not pass the previous High. The previous High - the direction won't pass the previous High.

52
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:48,199
The most recent High. I'm using "most recent High."

53
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:59,300
But if it exceeds - it looks like this.

54
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:05,199
It's strong. There's a chance the price bouncing back as Reaction...

55
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:12,500
Can beat the previous one. See? Yeah, goes up like this.

56
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:18,639
So the chart pattern or formation that should appear at different points...

57
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:22,500
This one is where? Right here. Goes up, consolidates.

58
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:25,120
Yeah, it doesn't have much strength, so it can't continue yet.

59
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:30,060
Just consolidates. After that, goes up again. Yeah, goes up again, then meets the other side.

60
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:33,300
Don't forget it has to be on both sides - not just one side.

61
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:36,759
On this side. Yeah, this side comes down, causing a pullback upward.

62
00:06:36,779 --> 00:06:39,939
This has to beat the original High. Here it forms a new High.

63
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:45,680
Following Dow Theory, right? This is a High.

64
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:56,540
It has to make Higher Highs continuously. So this one has to be characterized by strong upward movement - the power has to be strong. See how strong it is?

65
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:02,500
It beats this candlestick. So it pushes price up to make a new High.

66
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:08,420
Finally, when it goes up, it hits strong resistance.

67
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:15,240
Comes down and won't go back up. Now it hits this one - see?

68
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:19,839
What happens? Which side wins? Action, Reaction wins.

69
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:23,540
So it makes a Low that's lower than the previous Low. See?

70
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:27,959
Becomes a Lower Low from the previous Low here.

71
00:07:28,579 --> 00:07:32,300
Beats the previous Low going down because it's strong. Yeah, then continues down.

72
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:36,680
Here there's hesitation - goes sideways. Consolidating.

73
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:42,000
But we can say it's a price consolidation period. Then comes down again. Yeah, bounces up.

74
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:47,759
Hits this set - see? What happens? Action, Reaction - stronger force.

75
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:52,920
Can break through. Makes a new Low. Gets a Lower Low.

76
00:07:54,139 --> 00:07:56,600
Consolidates here, then goes back up.

77
00:07:57,079 --> 00:07:59,939
The price cycle looks like this.

78
00:08:00,339 --> 00:08:04,139
We use this to see if there's strong or weak power to beat...

79
00:08:04,819 --> 00:08:06,060
The previous High or previous Low.

80
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:11,060
Using the word "beat" - I mean if it's like this...

81
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:15,540
It won't pass the most recent High if it's trying to go up.

82
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:25,579
If it's on this side, might only go up this much. Down - both this one and this one.

83
00:08:25,899 --> 00:08:30,639
But if it's this one, there's a chance it'll beat the previous High.

84
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:34,240
If we say starting from here, it has to beat this High. Not this High.

85
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:39,399
Using "most recent High" - it'll beat that. But if it's this High and starts from here...

86
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:42,799
There's a chance it'll beat it and make a new High.

87
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:45,419
After going up doesn't mean it'll keep going up forever.

88
00:08:46,379 --> 00:08:48,379
It might pull back then continue.

89
00:08:48,379 --> 00:08:51,519
Or drop down completely.

90
00:08:51,879 --> 00:08:55,759
But definitely has more power or more chance than normal.

91
00:08:55,759 --> 00:08:57,259
Let's use "more than normal."

92
00:08:57,259 --> 00:08:59,379
That it'll beat the most recent High.

93
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:02,879
Or the most recent Low if it's a downtrend.

94
00:09:03,639 --> 00:09:06,200
For the one that has strong power like this.

95
00:09:07,559 --> 00:09:08,340
Goes up like this.

96
00:09:08,759 --> 00:09:11,980
Getting it? I'll explain in more detail.

97
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,620
Because it doesn't end here.

98
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:16,299
There are other patterns too.

99
00:09:16,299 --> 00:09:17,419
To help understand.

100
00:09:23,299 --> 00:09:26,159
Fresh page. It'll look like this.

101
00:09:26,519 --> 00:09:28,600
Now we already know when price goes up...

102
00:09:28,799 --> 00:09:33,460
This one's just called a normal pullback.

103
00:09:34,659 --> 00:09:38,679
But normally price has zigzags - zigzag pattern all the way through.

104
00:09:39,159 --> 00:09:41,759
Kind of odd-shaped like this.

105
00:09:41,759 --> 00:09:43,159
Could gradually go up again.

106
00:09:45,399 --> 00:09:47,879
Or even go up like this, then come down.

107
00:09:48,759 --> 00:09:52,580
And here - a candlestick set like this.

108
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:55,840
Where the power isn't enough to beat this High - might only go up this much.

109
00:09:56,539 --> 00:09:59,580
Then down again. Then comes to form a new one here.

110
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:03,620
A stronger candlestick pattern. Then breaks the High.

111
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:07,360
Could be in two sections like this. Let me expand on this.

112
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:11,860
Because what patterns are there? Actually there are many, many.

113
00:10:12,899 --> 00:10:20,159
Yeah, first one is sideways. What kind of sideways? Yeah, price comes up like this.

114
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:24,360
Yeah, then continues.

115
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:32,059
It has to be - yeah - triangle formation like this.

116
00:10:32,659 --> 00:10:36,139
See? Now where do the candlesticks sit?

117
00:10:36,799 --> 00:10:41,679
Like this, see? Yeah, price comes up, hits this point.

118
00:10:42,379 --> 00:10:45,480
Yeah, let me make it straight. Here, yeah.

119
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:57,559
Like this, see? Yeah, this goes down right? It already broke.

120
00:10:57,559 --> 00:11:02,559
Here there are candlesticks with strong power coming in. Making price go up like this.

121
00:11:02,879 --> 00:11:06,759
Boom! Then it hits this one. They can cancel each other out. It breaks if it's strong enough.

122
00:11:06,759 --> 00:11:12,100
Price drops down. Drops down and hits this one. Bounces back up - but you see?

123
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:17,519
What kind is it? Strong power? Medium. So can it beat this High?

124
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:23,600
Nope. So it's lower. Then hits this one. Here doesn't have enough power.

125
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:36,740
Light, weak force. So it can't make a new Low.

126
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:39,759
See? Until finally it hits this one.

127
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:45,179
Action and Reaction. Action this much, Reaction stronger.

128
00:11:45,559 --> 00:11:49,840
So it breaks upward. Makes this price shoot up.

129
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:52,840
Breaks through the range and continues following the original trend.

130
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:55,399
That's how it works. Based on understanding.

131
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:59,179
When applying it. But another type is what?

132
00:11:59,659 --> 00:12:04,200
Could be sideways like - um - what kind?

133
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:10,659
Yeah, separate first. Yeah, price comes up, sideways in a range.

134
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:17,100
Continues. Yeah, earlier was a triangle right?

135
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:20,519
This one's a box. Price comes up.

136
00:12:20,519 --> 00:12:24,340
Rectangle pattern like this. Running in a box.

137
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:28,019
Same thing. Yeah, price comes...

138
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:31,279
When it's running in a box, means there's nothing...

139
00:12:32,159 --> 00:12:33,419
Clear in either direction.

140
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:41,480
Not enough power until it hits one that has enough power like this.

141
00:12:42,779 --> 00:12:48,059
Simply put - when comparing, this one has more power than this one.

142
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:55,779
So when these two could never pass resistance...

143
00:12:57,139 --> 00:13:04,519
But when this one arrives - Action, Reaction says it has power - so it pushes price through upward.

144
00:13:05,259 --> 00:13:10,720
Remember? It has to happen at the same time. And it has to happen at new times.

145
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:14,820
Has to encounter this type.

146
00:13:17,659 --> 00:13:23,580
This is the continuation pattern. We're talking about uptrends where price continues like this.

147
00:13:25,019 --> 00:13:37,179
Where this part might just be a simple pullback, or price complexity right here - consolidating as sideways, in a box. Whatever box pattern it is.

148
00:13:39,399 --> 00:13:46,960
Getting it? Now what other patterns are there? This is continuation - both up and down. When it goes down it's the same thing.

149
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:54,720
You apply the same principles. Exactly the same.

150
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:59,320
So I'm just talking about one side first - the upside. The other side just reverse the thinking.

151
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:04,299
Now another one - this continues right? Another one is it DOESN'T continue.

152
00:14:05,899 --> 00:14:10,259
Boom! Goes down.

153
00:14:15,879 --> 00:14:22,879
It can't continue. Hits strong resistance.

154
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:30,600
What should happen? It tries but doesn't have enough power.

155
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:39,919
Doesn't form this one even once. But the top side comes back with more power.

156
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:43,460
This one isn't enough. Can't push it down.

157
00:14:44,519 --> 00:14:47,899
Finally the last one pushes down. A candlestick forms.

158
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:55,840
Candlestick set - Action, Reaction - with strong Reaction power compared to the previous one.

159
00:14:56,460 --> 00:15:03,720
Take the previous one. So this is the old Low - it can make a Lower Low or new Low.

160
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:09,139
The power's stronger. It's a failure to continue. Because there's what we call a reversal.

161
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:18,220
Besides this, what else? There's resistance - same as before, like this.

162
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:25,919
And what we're familiar with - double top.

163
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:33,120
So price looks the same. First one, Reaction is weak.

164
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:39,700
Second one, Reaction is stronger. And to break through like this, really strong...

165
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:50,899
Sometimes it balances. Let's go look. Could have way more power.

166
00:15:50,899 --> 00:15:53,039
Like this. Just breaks straight down.

167
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:55,779
Getting it?

168
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:58,720
It'll be like this. No matter which pattern - all the same.

169
00:15:59,799 --> 00:16:01,059
Could be like this.

170
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:11,480
What's this? Head and Shoulders, see? Exactly the same.

171
00:16:16,039 --> 00:16:19,240
It's simple - it'll be right here, this set.

172
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:22,000
This set makes it fail - right here.

173
00:16:24,159 --> 00:16:30,360
Something like this. This one doesn't have power - didn't meet this one, ended up here instead.

174
00:16:30,919 --> 00:16:35,139
It doesn't have it. It's a different one. After this one, only goes up this much.

175
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:39,460
Can't beat the previous High, the earlier High. But this one can beat the previous Low.

176
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:42,720
So price drops - adjusts downward like this. Reverses like this.

177
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:45,220
This is how to apply it.

178
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:48,700
So how many patterns do you know now?

179
00:16:49,059 --> 00:16:51,720
Whether it's at the top - a Top, right?

180
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:54,100
Bottom's the same.

181
00:16:55,159 --> 00:16:56,740
What else? Head and Shoulders.

182
00:16:56,740 --> 00:16:59,679
Or Inverted Head and Shoulders.

183
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:04,519
Including triangles.

184
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:06,200
Like this.

185
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:09,180
Or flags, or whatever.

186
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:12,880
It all follows these rules.

187
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:15,740
You need to observe the characteristics of the candlesticks forming.

188
00:17:16,279 --> 00:17:18,319
Including reading combined with other things.

189
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:20,460
That we learned from Season 1 and Season 2.

190
00:17:20,460 --> 00:17:22,119
Whether it's about Momentum.

191
00:17:23,299 --> 00:17:24,099
All of that.

192
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:26,480
The story - what story does it tell?

193
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:27,740
What clues does it leave?

194
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,319
Sometimes we don't find other clues.

195
00:17:30,319 --> 00:17:32,240
Or maybe Momentum is unclear - can't read it.

196
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:34,599
But are there signals showing us like this?

197
00:17:34,599 --> 00:17:36,920
This is what we use to read additionally.

198
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:37,839
Decode more.

199
00:17:37,839 --> 00:17:40,039
Not memorizing it has to be like this to go down.

200
00:17:40,039 --> 00:17:42,880
Understanding WHY it goes down.

201
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:44,900
Because Reaction only has this much.

202
00:17:45,599 --> 00:17:47,380
But when Action wins...

203
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:49,740
It closes lower than this one.

204
00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:52,279
So there's downward pressure.

205
00:17:52,279 --> 00:17:53,519
If it's an uptrend...

206
00:17:53,519 --> 00:17:55,140
The side that's about to reverse down.

207
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:58,319
Until it can beat the previous Low.

208
00:17:58,319 --> 00:18:00,460
Then forms a new Low.

209
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:02,259
Opposite for uptrends.

210
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:03,920
It has power.

211
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:05,839
Enough power to beat...

212
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:07,440
The previous High.

213
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:08,019
Right here.

214
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:10,180
Goes up to make a new High.

215
00:18:11,519 --> 00:18:13,500
Same thing, see? Higher than here.

216
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:14,680
This is Reaction.

217
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:20,420
Better if we compare to real charts.

218
00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:22,720
We'll understand even better.

219
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:23,599
Alright?

220
00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:26,799
About this much you should get it.

221
00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:28,539
These are the patterns.

222
00:18:28,539 --> 00:18:30,039
When using them, we don't memorize...

223
00:18:30,039 --> 00:18:31,980
Or understand it as...

224
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:34,660
Look at whether it's strong force...

225
00:18:34,660 --> 00:18:36,279
Medium or weak.

226
00:18:36,279 --> 00:18:38,599
Look at the Reaction side.

227
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:41,079
Because we want to know Reaction.

228
00:18:41,079 --> 00:18:43,740
And Action is part of it too.

229
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:49,700
In various patterns - which will already be at different points.

230
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:59,980
Whether it reverses a lot, reverses a little - it's all there. We consider everything.

231
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:07,460
Remember all its components. What does it need?

232
00:19:08,779 --> 00:19:14,180
Like this - one, two, three, four, five - how many rules? Various criteria. Can't remember? Go back and listen.

233
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:20,099
About that much. Next episode we'll look at real chart examples.
