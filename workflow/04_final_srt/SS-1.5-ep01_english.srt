1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,720
Alright, let's jump into Reversal Candlestick - this is a special episode, folks.

2
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:05,620
Yeah, this one's gonna be focused on reversal candlesticks.

3
00:00:06,419 --> 00:00:10,660
Now, those of you who've been following from the beginning know what's up.

4
00:00:10,939 --> 00:00:13,960
If you're new here, let me fill you in a bit.

5
00:00:14,099 --> 00:00:17,059
Basically, this whole series came from one simple question.

6
00:00:17,059 --> 00:00:21,239
Students were asking, "What's the difference between Season 1 and Season 2?"

7
00:00:21,379 --> 00:00:22,879
What are we actually learning here?

8
00:00:23,719 --> 00:00:26,539
So I thought, alright, let me break it down for you guys.

9
00:00:26,719 --> 00:00:30,620
Season 1, right? That was all about the basics.

10
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:33,060
What we call Foundation, the fundamentals.

11
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:37,159
Look, there are tons of different indicators out there.

12
00:00:37,659 --> 00:00:40,799
Some folks swear by RSI, others love MACD.

13
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:42,200
You know what I mean?

14
00:00:42,479 --> 00:00:47,020
So many different tools, and yeah, people use all kinds of stuff.

15
00:00:47,619 --> 00:00:49,280
Everyone's got their own preferred tools.

16
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:53,500
Now, in this course - and I gotta be clear about this.

17
00:00:54,179 --> 00:00:57,119
I'm not telling you this is the ONLY way to trade.

18
00:00:57,619 --> 00:01:00,460
What I'm teaching you is Price Action.

19
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:02,939
That's our approach, Price Action.

20
00:01:03,799 --> 00:01:08,260
Price Action means we're reading and analyzing just the price movement itself.

21
00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:12,400
Basically looking at candlestick charts and understanding what they're telling us.

22
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:16,060
And here's the thing - Season 1 had two main parts.

23
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:18,659
First part was Dow Theory.

24
00:01:18,980 --> 00:01:21,359
Now Dow Theory's got six principles.

25
00:01:21,599 --> 00:01:23,680
Actually, some people say there are more.

26
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:27,599
And yeah, I might've covered a bit extra beyond the main six.

27
00:01:28,599 --> 00:01:30,260
But anyway, there were six core principles.

28
00:01:30,439 --> 00:01:32,780
You gotta understand those, right?

29
00:01:33,579 --> 00:01:34,879
And after Dow Theory?

30
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:36,739
We dove into candlesticks.

31
00:01:36,739 --> 00:01:42,019
And look, when it comes to candlesticks, there are SO many different types and patterns.

32
00:01:42,319 --> 00:01:43,640
I mean, seriously, tons of them.

33
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:48,959
You could spend forever trying to memorize every single candlestick pattern out there.

34
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:53,420
But honestly? I'm not gonna make you memorize all that stuff.

35
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:55,560
We're gonna keep it simple and practical.

36
00:01:55,739 --> 00:02:01,040
I'll just show you - "Hey, when you see THIS pattern, here's what it means."

37
00:02:01,299 --> 00:02:05,780
Basically teaching you what each pattern is telling us, what it's saying about the market.

38
00:02:07,019 --> 00:02:11,860
And it's not just about recognizing patterns - we need to understand WHY they work.

39
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:14,080
Get the logic behind it, you know?

40
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:19,360
That way you're not just seeing random shapes - you actually GET what's happening in the market.

41
00:03:25,719 --> 00:03:27,259
So what does "complementary" mean here?

42
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:32,960
Alright, let me explain - sometimes you'll see charts that look different, various patterns, right?

43
00:03:33,159 --> 00:03:35,439
You might see this pattern, or you might not see that one.

44
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:40,939
But here's the thing - if you spot these together, whether it's from Season 1 OR Season 2.

45
00:03:40,939 --> 00:03:45,520
The more clues you stack up, the stronger your conviction becomes.

46
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:50,719
It really reinforces your forecast - makes it way more likely to play out.

47
00:03:50,719 --> 00:03:54,419
Yeah, it's gonna follow through just like you predicted.

48
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:58,259
So now, what are we gonna talk about in this one?

49
00:03:59,199 --> 00:04:01,039
Action and Reaction - that's today's topic.

50
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:03,939
I know some of you are wondering, "What's Action and Reaction?"

51
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:07,379
Think of it like forces, you know? Action force.

52
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:08,939
Action and Reaction forces.

53
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:14,360
Reaction is basically the force that pushes back in the opposite direction.

54
00:04:14,659 --> 00:04:17,480
Imagine a ping pong ball, or a soccer ball - whatever works for you.

55
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:21,120
You kick it, throw it - it hits the ground.

56
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:24,759
That impact force? That's what we call the Action.

57
00:04:24,759 --> 00:04:28,180
The ground responds by pushing force back.

58
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:33,639
That's what makes the ball bounce back up like that.

59
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:35,000
Makes sense?

60
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:40,360
So the ball comes down, and right here is the impact point.

61
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:42,759
And it bounces right back.

62
00:04:44,139 --> 00:04:46,079
That's the easiest way to explain it.

63
00:04:46,079 --> 00:04:48,500
Or you could just call it resistance force.

64
00:04:48,839 --> 00:04:50,180
Imagine if this was a wall.

65
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:50,540
Yeah.

66
00:04:51,819 --> 00:05:00,680
A car crashes into it - BOOM! Right? The force of the car coming from this side, all that energy coming this way, and then...

67
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:05,199
What happens to the front of the car? It gets crushed, wrecked. There's a反force coming back.

68
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:08,560
It's not just one-way force - it doesn't just pass through or anything like that.

69
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:13,100
It's not like the car stays perfectly fine, crashes through the wall and keeps going untouched.

70
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:17,079
No way! The car gets damaged, right? That's the reaction force at work.

71
00:05:17,079 --> 00:05:20,680
Same thing happens with candlesticks, folks.

72
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:23,360
Exactly the same principle with price movement.

73
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:28,300
So the Action is basically the price running in this direction.

74
00:05:29,399 --> 00:05:31,600
But normally with candlesticks...

75
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:34,160
From Season 1, we were looking for THIS pattern.

76
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:39,160
But you can't always find it, right? That's why we have what's called...

77
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:43,100
Combined candlesticks. Could be multiple candles - two, three, four, who knows.

78
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:47,180
But when you add and subtract all the movement together.

79
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:50,959
Boom! It forms a candlestick pattern.

80
00:05:50,959 --> 00:05:54,800
Like this, which I already explained back in Season 1.

81
00:05:54,800 --> 00:06:00,639
It represents the反force pushing back - that's one type of pattern.

82
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:03,560
Price was running down this way, and when you combine all those candlesticks together...

83
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:06,660
You get this formation - buying pressure bouncing back up.

84
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:08,839
If it's coming from a downtrend, right? Coming from downward movement.

85
00:06:12,399 --> 00:06:17,639
When it's coming down - boom, boom, boom - we see candlesticks forming in a cluster.

86
00:06:17,639 --> 00:06:19,360
They bunch up together, not appearing cleanly like this all at once.

87
00:06:20,439 --> 00:06:22,019
But when you combine them, you get this formation.

88
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:24,180
That wick, right? What it's showing us...

89
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:26,600
That's the Reaction happening.

90
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:29,319
Bouncing back from that Action side.

91
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,399
Trying to push price back in the other direction.

92
00:06:32,399 --> 00:06:33,720
The opposite side.

93
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:35,879
But it doesn't always work out that way.

94
00:06:35,879 --> 00:06:38,519
Sometimes we see a clean pattern like this before candlesticks even combine.

95
00:06:38,819 --> 00:06:40,319
And we think, "Oh yeah, it's gonna go this way."

96
00:06:40,759 --> 00:06:41,519
But no way!

97
00:06:41,519 --> 00:06:43,680
It comes down.

98
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,399
Gets to this point.

99
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:46,920
And keeps going down.

100
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:49,439
Because all the elements aren't there yet.

101
00:06:49,439 --> 00:06:50,959
I already covered this back in Season 1.

102
00:06:50,959 --> 00:06:56,360
What elements make this pattern work best?

103
00:06:57,060 --> 00:07:03,759
Don't forget - each candlestick we learned in Season 1 is like a character, showing different character types.

104
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:11,519
What makes a character perform their best? Or what they call having the clearest action? That's the SCENE.

105
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:16,019
What's a scene? Where should it occur? If you don't remember, go back and review our lessons.

106
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:22,040
Let's move on. So here's how it works, folks.

107
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:27,399
Action and Reaction - let's say this left side here is the Action.

108
00:07:27,839 --> 00:07:34,339
This side is Action, and then Reaction comes down - there's a反force pushing back.

109
00:07:34,839 --> 00:07:40,579
I'm talking about the downtrend side because it's easier to see. On the flip side, we have the uptrend.

110
00:07:40,579 --> 00:07:46,600
Price moves up, then reverses back down - same concept.

111
00:07:47,019 --> 00:07:52,439
But when talking about this side, price looks like it's moving up like this, and this side becomes the Reaction.

112
00:07:54,779 --> 00:07:57,899
Let me give you a simple visual - think of a balance scale.

113
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:05,120
A balance scale with arms on both sides like this.

114
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:10,019
Simply put, it's measuring forces.

115
00:08:10,579 --> 00:08:13,579
The force on this side has to be selling pressure.

116
00:08:16,399 --> 00:08:19,079
While this side has to be buying pressure pushing back.

117
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:22,240
But talking about selling pressure and buying pressure gets confusing.

118
00:08:22,819 --> 00:08:26,040
Right now, if we discuss this, you might get confused - wanna know why?

119
00:08:26,279 --> 00:08:31,800
Because over here, it's a downtrend - selling pressure is the Action.

120
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:36,340
Buying pressure pushing back is the Reaction - it's reversed because we're on the upper side.

121
00:08:37,159 --> 00:08:40,740
Yeah, price runs up, hits resistance - boom! Reverses.

122
00:08:42,039 --> 00:08:46,679
Earlier on this side, it was selling pressure - we still call it that.

123
00:08:46,679 --> 00:08:49,440
Buying pressure becomes the opposite, because it's on this side.

124
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:52,179
It becomes buying pressure - we call it buying pressure.

125
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:57,139
And selling pressure becomes the other side. Confusing, right? Going back and forth gets messy.

126
00:08:57,139 --> 00:08:59,759
So from now on, I'm just gonna use TWO words.

127
00:08:59,759 --> 00:09:01,399
That's Action and Reaction.

128
00:09:01,399 --> 00:09:04,620
And they stay on the same side consistently.

129
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:07,100
Doesn't matter if it's top or bottom.

130
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:11,940
Going up? That's Action.

131
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,279
This one's the Reaction.

132
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:16,639
This side coming down? That's Action.

133
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:17,700
Going up is Reaction.

134
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:20,320
It just becomes left side versus right side, that's all.

135
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:20,899
Alright?

136
00:09:20,899 --> 00:09:27,460
This side - the left - is ALL Action. This side - the right - is ALL Reaction.

137
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:32,299
Keep it simple. It's gonna look like this - this is the pattern we're looking for.

138
00:09:32,299 --> 00:09:49,879
Back in Season 1, we might've only needed this much. But now we want MORE confirmation.

139
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:49,879
Stay tuned for the next episode.
